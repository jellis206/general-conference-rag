COMPARISON REPORT: Semantic Search Strategies
================================================================================

ANALYSIS OF GRANULARITY DIFFERENCES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. FULL-TEXT EMBEDDINGS (Talks)
   - Captures overall themes and messages of entire talks
   - Best for: Broad thematic queries, finding talks with similar overall messages
   - Limitation: May miss specific details or examples within talks

2. PARAGRAPH EMBEDDINGS
   - Focuses on individual paragraphs as retrieval units
   - Best for: Specific questions requiring precise teachings or examples
   - Limitation: May lose broader context of the full talk

3. CLUSTER EMBEDDINGS (k=3)
   - Groups paragraphs into thematic clusters within each talk
   - Best for: Balanced approach between specificity and context
   - Limitation: Clustering may not always align with natural talk structure
