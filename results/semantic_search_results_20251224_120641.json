          "text": "When I was a child, Frank Talley, a member of the Church, offered to help my family fly from Puerto Rico to Salt Lake City so we could be sealed in the temple, but soon obstacles began to appear. One of my sisters, Marivid, became ill. Unsettled, my parents prayed about what to do and still felt prompted to make the journey. They trusted that as they faithfully followed the Lords prompting, our family would be watched over and blessedand we were.\n\nNo matter the obstacles we face in life, we can trust that Jesus Christ will prepare a way forward as we walk with faith. God has promised that all who live according to the covenants they have made with Him will, in His time, receive all His promised blessings. Elder JeffreyR. Holland taught, Some blessings come soon, some come late, and some dont come until heaven; but for those who embrace the gospel of Jesus Christ, they come.\n\nMoroni taught that faith is things which are hoped for and not seen; wherefore, dispute not because ye see not, for ye receive no witness until after the trial of your faith.\n\nOur question is, What should we do to best meet the trials that come our way?\n\nIn his first public remarks as President of the Church, President RussellM. Nelson taught: As a new Presidency, we want to begin with the end in mind. For this reason, were speaking to you today from a temple. The end for which each of us strives is to be endowed with power in a house of the Lord, sealed as families, faithful to covenants made in a temple that qualify us for the greatest gift of Godthat of eternal life. The ordinances of the temple and the covenants you make there are key to strengthening your life, your marriage and family, and your ability to resist the attacks of the adversary. Your worship in the temple and your service there for your ancestors will bless you with increased personal revelation and peace and will fortify your commitment to stay on the covenant path.\n\nAs we follow Gods voice and His covenant path, He will strengthen us in our trials.\n\nMy familys trip to the temple years ago was difficult, but as we approached the temple in Salt Lake City, Utah, my mother, full of joy and faith, said, We are going to be OK; the Lord will protect us. We were sealed as a family, and my sister recovered. This happened only after the trial of my parents faith and in following the Lords promptings.\n\nThis example of my parents still influences our lives today. Their example taught us the why of gospel doctrine and helped us understand the meaning, purpose, and blessings that the gospel brings. Understanding the why of the gospel of Jesus Christ can also help us face our trials with faith.\n\nUltimately, everything God invites and commands us to do is an expression of His love for us and His desire to give us the blessings reserved for the faithful. We cannot assume that our children will learn to love the gospel on their own; it is our responsibility to teach them. As we help our children learn how to use their agency wisely, our example can inspire them to make their own righteous choices. Their faithful living will in turn help their children to know the truth of the gospel for themselves.\n\nYoung men and young women, hear the prophet today talking to you. Seek to learn divine truths and seek to understand the gospel for yourselves. President Nelson recently counseled: What wisdom do you lack?  Follow the example of the Prophet Joseph. Find a quiet place.  Humble yourself before God. Pour out your heart to your Heavenly Father. Turn to Him for answers. As you seek guidance from your loving Heavenly Father, listening to the counsel of living prophets and watching the example of righteous parents, you too can become a strong link of faith in your family.\n\nTo parents with children who have left the covenant path, gently go back. Help them comprehend the gospels truths. Start now; it is never too late.\n\nOur example of righteous living can make a great difference. President Nelson has said: As Latter-day Saints, we have become accustomed to thinking of church as something that happens in our meetinghouses, supported by what happens at home. We need an adjustment to this pattern. It is time for a home-centered Church, supported by what takes place inside our branch, ward, and stake buildings.\n\nThe scriptures teach, Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it.\n\nThey also say, And now, as the preaching of the word had a great tendency to lead the people to do that which was justyea, it had had more powerful effect upon the minds of the people than the sword, or anything else, which had happened unto themtherefore Alma thought it was expedient that they should try the virtue of the word of God.\n\nA story is told of a woman who was upset that her son was eating too much candy. No matter how much she told him to stop, he continued to satisfy his sweet tooth. Totally frustrated, she decided to take her son to see a wise man whom he respected.\n\nShe approached him and said, Sir, my son eats too much candy. Would you please tell him to stop eating it?\n\nHe listened carefully then said to her son, Go home and come back in two weeks.\n\nShe took her son and went home, perplexed why he had not asked the boy to stop eating so much candy.\n\nTwo weeks later they returned. The wise man looked directly at the boy and said, Boy, you should stop eating so much candy. It is not good for your health.\n\nThe boy nodded and promised he would.\n\nThe boys mother asked, Why didnt you tell him that two weeks ago?\n\nThe wise man smiled. Two weeks ago I was still eating too much candy myself.\n\nThis man lived with such integrity that he knew his advice would carry power only if he was following his own counsel.\n\nThe influence we have on our children is more powerful as they see us walking faithfully on the covenant path. The Book of Mormon prophet Jacob is an example of such righteousness. His son Enos wrote of the impact of his fathers teachings:\n\nI, Enos, knowing my father that he was a just manfor he taught me in his language, and also in the nurture and admonition of the Lordand blessed be the name of my God for it.\n\nAnd the words which I had often heard my father speak concerning eternal life, and the joy of the saints, sunk deep into my heart.\n\nThe mothers of the stripling warriors lived the gospel, and their children were filled with conviction. Their leader reported:\n\nThey had been taught by their mothers, that if they did not doubt, God would deliver them.\n\nAnd they rehearsed unto me the words of their mothers, saying: We do not doubt our mothers knew it.\n\nEnos and the stripling warriors were strengthened by the faith of their parents, which helped them meet their own trials of faith.\n\nWe are blessed with the restored gospel of Jesus Christ in our days, which lifts us when we feel discouraged or troubled. We are reassured that our efforts will bear fruit in the Lords own due time if we press forward through the trials of our faith.\n\nMy wife and I, with the Area Presidency, recently accompanied Elder DavidA. Bednar to the dedication of the Port-au-Prince Haiti Temple. Our son Jorge, who came with us, said about his experience: Amazing, Papa! As soon as Elder Bednar started with the dedicatory prayer, I could feel the room fill with warmth and light. The prayer added so much to my understanding of the purpose of a temple. It really is the house of the Lord.\n\nIn the Book of Mormon, Nephi teaches that as we desire to know the will of God, He will strengthen us. He wrote, I, Nephi, being exceedingly young  and also having great desires to know of the mysteries of God, wherefore, I did cry unto the Lord; and behold he did visit me, and did soften my heart that I did believe all the words which had been spoken by my father; wherefore, I did not rebel against him like unto my brothers.\n\nBrothers and sisters, let us help our children and all around us to follow Gods covenant path so that the Spirit might teach them and soften their hearts to desire to follow Him throughout their life.\n\nAs I consider the example of my parents, I realize that our faith in the Lord Jesus Christ will show us the way back to our heavenly home. I know miracles come after the trial of our faith.\n\nI bear testimony of Jesus Christ and His atoning sacrifice. I know He is our Savior and Deliverer. He and our Heavenly Father came that morning in the spring of 1820 to young Joseph Smith, the prophet of the Restoration. President RussellM. Nelson is the prophet of our day. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen."

          "text": "Sisters and brothers, thank you for your faithful devotion in coming unto Jesus Christ during these challenging times. You are wonderful; you are beautiful; you are each a child of God. It is my prayer that we will recognize the influence of the Holy Ghost as we become and help one another become truly devoted disciples of Jesus Christ and feel of His joy as we worship in the house of the Lord.\n\nPresident RussellM. Nelson declared: Now is the time for you and for me to prepare for the Second Coming of our Lord and Savior, Jesus the Christ. Now is the time for us to make our discipleship our highest priority. In a world filled with dizzying distractions, how can we do this?\n\nHe provided the answer: Regular worship in the temple will help us. In the house of the Lord, we focus on Jesus Christ. We come to know Him. Every sincere seeker of Jesus Christ will find Him in the temple.\n\nSo how do we become and help one another become devoted disciples of Jesus Christ? We minister to the one. Ministering in the Saviors way involves compassion, kindness, patience, and love without judgment. As we minister to the one, we invite the one to come unto Christ and to worship in the house of the Lord to receive of His redeeming power. In other words, we help one another become devoted disciples as we minister to the one in ways that lead to the house of the Lord.\n\nWe learn from Jesus Christ the power of ministering to the one with love and without judgment. You remember the Samaritan woman at the well. This woman may have felt unimportant, alone, discouraged, and unseen. She may have felt she did not belong. Throughout her life she had five husbands, and the man whom she was living with was not her husband. Others may have imposed unrighteous judgment without knowing her lifes circumstances. This may be one of the reasons she came to the well alone in the hottest part of the day. And yet, she was one of the first to whom Jesus Christ declared He was the Messiah. To Him, this woman was a daughter of God.\n\nJesus Christ taught that woman that through Him one can receive eternal life by partaking of the living water. He declared, Whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give  shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give  shall be  a well of water springing up into everlasting life.\n\nThe woman of Samaria felt of the Saviors love and received a witness through the Spirit that He is the Messiah. After this witness, she returned to the city and invited others to come and see, and many believed Jesus was indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world. Christ ministered to the one with love; as a result, others became His devoted disciples.\n\nWe learn of the power of ministering to the one with compassion from Christs Apostles Peter and John. You remember a certain man, lame from birth, lay daily at the gate of the temple asking for money. This man may have felt unimportant, alone, discouraged, and unseen. He may have felt he did not belong.\n\nThen Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have [I] give [unto] thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk.\n\nPeter took the man by his right hand and lifted him up, and the man was made whole. Immediately following the miracle, the man entered into the temple with Peter and John, walking, and leaping, and praising God. Peter and John ministered to the one in ways that led to the house of the Lord, and this man became Christs devoted disciple.\n\nMy friends, there have been moments in my life when I too have felt unimportant, alone, discouraged, and unseen. I have felt as if I did not belong. I was baptized and confirmed a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when I was 19 years old. One year later, I accepted the call to serve as a full-time missionary, but there was much I had not yet learned about Church history.\n\nEarly in my missionary service, I learned that there was a period when those of Black African descent were not allowed to enjoy all of the blessings of worshipping in the house of the Lord. Learning this for the first time brought feelings of anger, confusion, doubt, and fear. These feelings were so intense that my ability to recognize the Holy Ghost was lost for a season.\n\nFortunately, I had a wonderful missionary companion, Kevin Vick, who ministered to me with love, patience, and kindness. Each night as he witnessed my feelings of doubt and uncertainty, he would simply say to the younger Elder Johnson, I love you. After about two weeks, I allowed myself to feel of Kevins love. I gained the courage to pray to Heavenly Father in the name of Jesus Christ. As I prayed, I was drawn to section 6 of the Doctrine and Covenants, verses 2123, which states:\n\nBehold, I am Jesus Christ, the Son of God.  I am the light which shineth in darkness.\n\nCast your mind upon the night that you cried unto me in your heart, that you might know concerning the truth of these things.\n\nDid I not speak peace to your mind concerning the matter? What greater witness can you have than from God?\n\nAs I read, I remembered. I remembered the day that I had fasted and prayed to know that the Book of Mormon is the word of God and that Joseph Smith is the Prophet of the Restoration. I remembered covenants made in the house of the Lord that connect me to Jesus Christ in such a personal and intimate way. I felt of the Saviors love, His mercy, and His assurance that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is His kingdom upon the earth and is necessary to prepare us for His Second Coming. Because I remembered, I again was able to recognize the Holy Ghost and to understand more fully that Jesus is the Christ and I am His disciple.\n\nAt times we will have unanswered questions and feelings of being unimportant, discouraged, alone, and unseen. However, my friends, we must press forward with faith in Jesus Christ and remember His words:\n\nLet not your heart be troubled.\n\nIn the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.\n\nI am a witness to this reality and of the Saviors promised blessing.\n\nSo what can we do to ensure our ministering to the one in the Saviors way is most effective? Living the doctrine of Christ will help us. Living the doctrine of Christ, as President Nelson described, can produce the most powerful virtuous cycle, creating spiritual momentum in our lives.\n\nAs we strive to live the higher laws of Jesus Christ,  the Savior lifts us above the pull of this fallen world by blessing us with greater charity, humility, generosity, kindness, self-discipline, peace, and rest.\n\n[This spiritual] momentum produced by living the doctrine of Christ, Elder DaleG. Renlund explains, not only powers the transformation of our divine nature into our eternal destiny but also motivates us to help [to minister to] others in appropriate ways. Elder Renlund reminds us that the Saviors job is to heal [to make us whole]. Our job is to loveto love and minister in such a way that others are drawn to Jesus Christ.\n\nOur ability to live the doctrine of Christ will be enhanced by daily studying the Book of Mormon and weekly partaking of the sacrament. President Nelson declared that the Book of Mormon teaches the doctrine of Christ  [and] provides the fullest and [clearest] understanding of the Atonement of Jesus Christ to be found anywhere. I love this book. And prayerfully partaking of the sacrament each week will increase our understanding of the Atonement of Jesus Christ and provide spiritual renewal, comfort, and the power of godliness in our lives. Remember, in the ordinances [of the priesthood], the power of godliness is manifest, and this power, which comes from Jesus Christ, strengthens our desire and our ability to minister to the one.\n\nMy study of the Book of Mormon and partaking of the sacrament minimizes feelings of discouragement, escalates my determination to minister to the one in the Saviors way, and helps make discipleship my highest priority.\n\nMy friends, I promise that as we live the doctrine of Christ and minister to the one in ways that lead to the house of the Lord, we will press forward with faith in Jesus Christ even amid unanswered questions and feelings of being unimportant, alone, discouraged, and unseen. We will invite the one to come unto Jesus Christ and to worship in the house of the Lord to receive of His redeeming power and love. In the house of the Lord, we will feel [the Saviors] mercy. [We] will find answers to [our] most vexing questions. [And we] will better comprehend the joy of His gospel. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen."

          "text": "I express my love for you, our beloved friends and fellow believers. I have admired your faith and courage during these past months, as this worldwide pandemic has disrupted our lives and taken precious family members and dear friends.\n\nDuring this period of uncertainty, I have felt an unusual gratitude for my sure and certain knowledge that Jesus is the Christ. Have you felt that way? There are difficulties that weigh upon each of us, but always before us is He who humbly declared, I am the way, the truth, and the life. While we endure a season of physically distancing ourselves from others, we need never endure a season of spiritually distancing ourselves from Him who lovingly calls to us, Come unto me.\n\nLike a guiding star in a clear, dark sky, Jesus Christ lights our way. He came to earth in a humble stable. He lived a perfect life. He healed the sick and raised the dead. He was a friend to the forgotten. He taught us to do good, to obey, and to love one another. He was crucified on a cross, rising majestically three days later, allowing us and those we love to live beyond the grave. With His incomparable mercy and grace, He took upon Himself our sins and our suffering, bringing forgiveness as we repent and peace in the storms of life. We love Him. We worship Him. We follow Him. He is the anchor of our souls.\n\nInterestingly, while this spiritual conviction is increasing within us, there are many on the earth who know very little of Jesus Christ, and in some parts of the world where His name has been proclaimed for centuries, faith in Jesus Christ is diminishing. The valiant Saints in Europe have seen belief decline in their countries through the decades. Sadly, here in the United States faith is also receding. A recent study revealed that in the last 10 years, 30 million people in the United States have stepped away from believing in the divinity of Jesus Christ. Looking worldwide, another study predicts that in the decades ahead, more than twice as many will leave Christianity as will embrace it.\n\nWe, of course, revere the right of each to choose, yet our Heavenly Father declared, This is my beloved Son: hear him. I witness that the day will come when every knee will bow and every tongue confess that Jesus is the Christ.\n\nHow are we to respond to our changing world? While some are neglecting their faith, others are searching for the truth. We have taken upon ourselves the name of the Savior. What more are we to do?\n\nPart of our answer may come as we remember how the Lord tutored President RussellM. Nelson in the months prior to his call as President of the Church. Speaking one year before his call, President Nelson invited us to more deeply study the 2,200 references of the name Jesus Christ listed in the Topical Guide.\n\nThree months later, in April general conference, he spoke of how, even with his decades of devoted discipleship, this deeper study of Jesus Christ had greatly affected him. Sister Wendy Nelson asked him about its impact. He replied, I am a different man! He was a different man? At age 92, a different man? President Nelson explained:\n\nAs we invest time in learning about the Savior and His atoning sacrifice, we are drawn to [Him].\n\nOur focus [becomes] riveted on the Savior and His gospel.\n\nThe Savior said, Look unto me in every thought.\n\nIn a world of work, worries, and worthy endeavors, we keep our heart, our mind, and our thoughts on Him who is our hope and salvation.\n\nIf a renewed study of the Savior helped prepare President Nelson, could it not help prepare us as well?\n\nIn emphasizing the name of the Church, President Nelson taught, If we  are to have access to the power of the Atonement of Jesus Christto cleanse and heal us, to strengthen and magnify us, and ultimately to exalt uswe must clearly acknowledge Him as the source of that power. President Nelson taught us that consistently using the correct name of the Church, something that might seem like a small thing, is not small at all and will shape the worlds future.\n\nI promise you that as you prepare yourselves, as President Nelson did, you too will be different, thinking more about the Savior, speaking of Him more frequently and with less hesitation. As you come to know and love Him even more deeply, your words will flow more comfortably, as they do when you speak of one of your children or of a dear friend. Those listening to you will feel less like debating or dismissing you and more like learning from you.\n\nYou and I speak of Jesus Christ, but maybe we can do a little better. If the world is going to speak less of Him, who is going to speak more of Him? We are! Along with other devoted Christians!\n\nAre there images of the Savior in our homes? Do we talk often to our children about the parables of Jesus? The stories of Jesus [are] like a rushing wind across the embers of faith in the hearts of our children. When your children ask you questions, consciously think about teaching what the Savior taught. For example, if your child asks, Daddy, why do we pray? You might respond, Thats a great question. Do you remember when Jesus prayed? Lets talk about why He prayed and how He prayed.\n\nWe talk of Christ, we rejoice in Christ,  that our children may know to what source they may look for a remission of their sins.\n\nThis same scripture adds that we preach of Christ. In our worship services, let us focus on the Savior Jesus Christ and the gift of His atoning sacrifice. This does not mean we cannot tell an experience from our own life or share thoughts from others. While our subject might be about families or service or temples or a recent mission, everything in our worship should point to the Lord Jesus Christ.\n\nThirty years ago, President DallinH. Oaks spoke of a letter he had received from a man who said he had attended [a sacrament] meeting and listened to seventeen testimonies without hearing the Savior mentioned. President Oaks then noted, Perhaps that description is exaggerated [but] I quote it because it provides a vivid reminder for all of us. He then invited us to speak more of Jesus Christ in our talks and class discussions. I have observed that we are focusing more and more on Christ in our Church meetings. Lets consciously continue with these very positive efforts.\n\nWith those around us, let us be more open, more willing to talk of Christ. President Nelson said, True disciples of Jesus Christ are willing to stand out, speak up, and be different from the people of the world.\n\nSometimes we think that a conversation with someone needs to result in them coming to church or seeing the missionaries. Let the Lord guide them as they are willing, while we think more about our responsibility to be a voice for Him, thoughtful and open about our faith. Elder DieterF. Uchtdorf has taught us that when someone asks us about our weekend, we should be willing to happily respond that we loved hearing the Primary children sing, Im trying to be like Jesus. Let us kindly witness our faith in Christ. If someone shares a problem in his or her personal life, we might say, John, Mary, you know that I believe in Jesus Christ. I have been thinking about something He said that might help you.\n\nBe more open on social media in talking about your trust in Christ. Most will respect your faith, but if someone is dismissive when you speak of the Savior, take courage in His promise: Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you  for my sake.  For great is your reward in heaven. We care more about being His followers than being liked by our own followers. Peter counseled, Be ready always to give an answer [for] the hope that is in you. Let us talk of Christ.\n\nThe Book of Mormon is a powerful witness of Jesus Christ. Virtually every page testifies of the Savior and His divine mission. An understanding of His Atonement and grace saturates its pages. As a companion to the New Testament, the Book of Mormon helps us better understand why the Savior came to rescue us and how we can more profoundly come unto Him.\n\nSome of our fellow Christians are, at times, uncertain about our beliefs and motives. Let us genuinely rejoice with them in our shared faith in Jesus Christ and in the New Testament scriptures we all love. In the days ahead, those who believe in Jesus Christ will need the friendship and support of one another.\n\nAs the world speaks less of Jesus Christ, let us speak more of Him. As our true colors as His disciples are revealed, many around us will be prepared to listen. As we share the light we have received from Him, His light and His transcendent saving power will shine on those willing to open their hearts. Jesus said, I  come [as] a light into the world.\n\nNothing lifts my desire to speak of Christ more than visualizing His return. While we do not know when He will come, the events of His return will be breathtaking! He will come in the clouds of heaven in majesty and glory with all His holy angels. Not just a few angels but all His holy angels. These are not the cherry-cheeked cherubim painted by Raphael, found on our Valentine cards. These are the angels of the centuries, the angels sent to shut the mouths of lions, to open prison doors, to announce His long-awaited birth, to comfort Him in Gethsemane, to assure His disciples at His Ascension, and to open the glorious Restoration of the gospel.\n\nCan you imagine being caught up to meet Him, whether on this side or the other side of the veil? That is His promise to the righteous. This amazing experience will mark our souls forever.\n\nHow grateful we are for our beloved prophet, President RussellM. Nelson, who has lifted our desire to love the Savior and proclaim His divinity. I am an eyewitness to the Lords hand upon him and the gift of revelation that guides him. President Nelson, we eagerly await your counsel.\n\nMy dear friends across the world, let us talk of Christ, anticipating His glorious promise: Whosoever  shall confess me before men, him will I confess  before my Father. I testify He is the Son of God. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen."

          "text": "Defining moments in life come often and unexpectedly, even when you are still young. Allow me to share a story about a high school student, Kevin, chosen to travel out of state for a student leader event, as told in his own words.\n\nMy turn in line came, and the official-looking registration clerk asked for my name. She looked at her list and said, So youre the young man from Utah.\n\nYou mean Im the only one? I asked.\n\nYes, the only one. She handed me my name tag with Utah printed below my name. As I clipped it on, I felt like I was being branded.\n\nI crowded into the hotel elevator with five other high school students with name tags like mine. Hey, youre from Utah. Are you a Mormon? asked one student.\n\nI felt out of place with all these student leaders from all over the country. Yes, I hesitantly admitted.\n\nYoure the guys who believe in Joseph Smith, who said he saw angels. You dont actually believe that, do you?\n\nI didnt know what to say. The students in the elevator were all staring at me. I had just arrived, and already everyone thought I was different. I became a little defensive but then said, I know that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God.\n\nWhere had that come from? I wondered. I didnt know I had it in me. But the words felt true.\n\nYeah, I was told that you were all just religious nuts, he said.\n\nWith that, there was an uncomfortable pause as the elevator door opened. As we gathered our luggage, he walked down the hall laughing.\n\nThen, a voice behind me asked, Hey, dont Mormons have some sort of another Bible?\n\nOh no. Not again. I turned to see another student who had been in the elevator with me, Christopher.\n\nIts called the Book of Mormon, I said, wanting to drop the subject. I picked up my bags and started walking down the hall.\n\nIs that the book Joseph Smith translated? he asked.\n\nYeah, it is, I answered. I kept on walking, hoping to avoid embarrassment.\n\nWell, do you know how I could get one?\n\nA scripture I learned in seminary suddenly came to me. I am not ashamed of the gospel of Jesus Christ. As this entered my mind, I felt ashamed I had been so embarrassed.\n\nFor the rest of the week that scripture wouldnt leave me. I answered as many questions about the Church as I could, and I made many friends.\n\nI discovered I was proud of my religion.\n\nI gave Christopher a Book of Mormon. He later wrote me, telling me he had invited the missionaries to his home.\n\nI learned not to be embarrassed to share my testimony.\n\nI am inspired by Kevins courage in sharing his testimony. It is a courage repeated every day by faithful members of the Church throughout the world. As I share my thoughts, I invite you to reflect upon these four questions:\n\nDo I know and understand what a testimony is?\n\nDo I know how to bear my testimony?\n\nWhat are the obstacles in sharing my testimony?\n\nHow do I keep my testimony?\n\nYour testimony is a most precious possession, often associated with deep spiritual feelings. These feelings are usually communicated quietly and described as a still small voice. It is your belief or knowledge of truth given as a spiritual witness through the influence of the Holy Ghost. Acquiring this witness will change what you say and how you act. Key elements of your testimony, confirmed by the Holy Ghost, include:\n\nGod is your Heavenly Father; you are His child. He loves you.\n\nJesus Christ lives. He is the Son of the living God and your Savior and Redeemer.\n\nJoseph Smith is a prophet of God called to restore the Church of Jesus Christ.\n\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is Gods restored Church on the earth.\n\nThe restored Church of Jesus Christ is led by a living prophet today.\n\nYou bear your testimony when you share spiritual feelings with others. As a member of the Church, you have opportunities to bear your spoken testimony in formal Church meetings or in less formal, one-on-one conversations with family, friends, and others.\n\nAnother way you share your testimony is through righteous behavior. Your testimony in Jesus Christ isnt just what you sayits who you are.\n\nEach time you bear vocal witness or demonstrate through your actions your commitment to follow Jesus Christ, you invite others to come unto Christ.\n\nMembers of the Church stand as witnesses of God at all times, in all things, and in all places. Opportunities to do this in the digital universe using inspiring content of our own or sharing uplifting content prepared by others are endless. We testify when we love, share, and invite, even online. Your tweets, direct messages, and posts will take on a higher, holier purpose when you also use social media to show how the gospel of Jesus Christ shapes your life.\n\nObstacles to sharing your testimony may include uncertainty about what to say. Matthew Cowley, an early Apostle, shared this experience as he departed on a five-year mission at age 17 to New Zealand:\n\nI will never forget the prayers of my father the day that I left. I have never heard a more beautiful blessing in all my life. Then his last words to me at the railroad station, My boy, you will go out on that mission; you will study; you will try to prepare your sermons; and sometimes when you are called upon, you will think you are wonderfully prepared, but when you stand up, your mind will go completely blank. I have had that experience more than once.\n\nI said, What do you do when your mind goes blank?\n\nHe said, You stand up there and with all the fervor of your soul, you bear witness that Joseph Smith was a prophet of the living God, and thoughts will flood into your mind and words to your mouth  to the heart of everyone who listens. And so my mind, being mostly blank during my  mission , gave me the opportunity to bear testimony to the greatest event in the history of the world since the crucifixion of the Master. Try it sometime, fellows and girls. If you dont have anything else to say, testify that Joseph Smith was the prophet of God, and the whole history of the Church will flood into your mind.\n\nLikewise, President DallinH. Oaks shared, Some testimonies are better gained on the feet bearing them than on the knees praying for them. The Spirit bears witness to the speaker and listener alike.\n\nAnother obstacle, as Kevins story emphasized, is fear. As Paul wrote to Timothy:\n\nGod hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love.\n\nBe not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord.\n\nFeelings of fear dont come from the Lord but most often from the adversary. Having faith, as Kevin did, will allow you to overcome these feelings and freely share what is in your heart.\n\nI believe a testimony is innate within us, yet, in order to keep it and more fully develop it, Alma taught that we must nourish our testimony with much care. As we do so, it will get root, and grow up, and bring forth fruit. Without this, it withers away.\n\nEach beloved member of the First Presidency has provided us with direction on how to keep a testimony.\n\nPresident HenryB. Eyring lovingly taught us that feasting on the word of God, heartfelt prayer, and obedience to the Lords commandments must be applied evenly and continually for your testimony to grow and prosper.\n\nPresident DallinH. Oaks reminded us that to retain our testimony, we need to partake of the sacrament each week (see D&C 59:9) to qualify for the precious promise that we will always have his Spirit to be with [us] (D&C 20:77).\n\nAnd President RussellM. Nelson kindly counseled recently:\n\nFeed [your testimony] truth.\n\nNourish yourself in the words of ancient and modern prophets. Ask the Lord to teach you how to hear Him better. Spend more time in the temple and in family history work.\n\nMake your testimony your highest priority.\n\nMy beloved brothers and sisters, I promise that as you more fully understand what a testimony is, and as you share it, you will overcome obstacles of uncertainty and fear, enabling you to nurture and keep this most precious possession, your testimony.\n\nWe are blessed to have countless examples of ancient and modern-day prophets who have boldly borne their testimonies.\n\nFollowing Christs death, Peter stood and testified:\n\nBe it known unto you all  that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead,  doth this man stand here before you.\n\nFor there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.\n\nAmulek, following Almas sermon on faith, stated powerfully: I will testify unto you of myself that these things are true. Behold, I say unto you, that I do know that Christ shall come among the children of men,  and that he shall atone for the sins of the world; for the Lord God hath spoken it.\n\nJoseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon, upon witnessing a glorious vision of the resurrected Savior, testified:\n\nAnd now, after the many testimonies which have been given of him, this is the testimony, last of all, which we give of him: That he lives!\n\nFor we saw him, even on the right hand of God; and we heard the voice bearing record that he is the Only Begotten of the Father.\n\nBrothers and sisters, I invite you to seek opportunities to bear your testimony in word and in deed. Such an opportunity came to me recently, at the end of a meeting with the mayor of a capital city in South America, in his chambers with a number of his cabinet officials. As we concluded with very cordial feelings, I hesitantly thought I should share my testimony. Following the prompting, I offered a witness that Jesus Christ is the Son of the living God and the Savior of the world. Everything changed at that moment. The Spirit in the room was undeniable. It seemed everyone was touched. The Comforter  beareth record of the Father and of the Son. I am so grateful I summoned the courage to bear my testimony.\n\nWhen a moment like this comes, grab it and embrace it. You will feel the warmth of the Comforter inside you when you do.\n\nI offer my testimony and witness to youGod is our Heavenly Father, Jesus Christ lives, and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is Gods Church on the earth today led by our dear prophet, President RussellM. Nelson. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen."

          "text": "Five years ago today, we raised our hands to sustain our beloved prophet, President RussellM. Nelson, as President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saintsthe Lords mouthpiece for this remarkable season of growth and revelation. Through him, we have received countless invitations and have been promised glorious blessings if we will center our lives on our Savior, Jesus Christ.\n\nIn 2011, while I was serving with my husband as mission leaders in beautiful Curitiba, Brazil, my phone rang during a meeting. Rushing to silence it, I noticed the call was from my father. I quickly left the meeting to answer: Hi, Dad!\n\nUnexpectedly, his voice was filled with emotion: Hi, Bonnie. I need to tell you something. Ive been diagnosed with ALS.\n\nMy mind swirled with confusion, Wait! What is ALS?\n\nDad was already explaining, My mind will stay alert while my body slowly shuts down.\n\nI felt my whole world shift as I began to wrestle with the implications of this grievous news. But on that unforgettable day, it was his last sentence that found a permanent place in my heart. My dear father said with urgency, Bonnie, never give up an opportunity to testify of Christ.\n\nI have pondered and prayed over Dads counsel. I have often asked myself if I fully know what it means to never give up an opportunity to testify of Jesus Christ.\n\nLike you, I have occasionally stood on the first Sunday of the month and borne a witness of Christ. Many times I have testified of gospel truths as part of a lesson. I have boldly taught truth and declared the divinity of Christ as a missionary.\n\nYet this plea felt more personal! It seemed as though he was saying, Bonnie, dont let the world overtake you! Stay true to your covenants with the Savior. Seek to experience His blessings every day, and be able to testify through the Holy Ghost of His power and presence in your life!\n\nWe live in a fallen world, with distractions coaxing our eyes and hearts downward instead of heavenward. Much like the Nephites in 3Nephi 11, we need Jesus Christ. Can you imagine yourself there, among people who had experienced so much chaos and destruction? What would it be like to hear the Lords personal invitation:\n\nArise and come forth unto me, that ye may thrust your hands into my side, and also that ye may feel the prints of the nails in my hands and in my feet, that ye may know that I am  the God of the whole earth, and have been slain for the sins of the world.\n\nAnd  the multitude went forth  one by one  and did see with their eyes and did feel with their hands, and did know  and had witnessed for themselves.\n\nThese Nephites eagerly went forward to thrust their hands into His side and feel the prints of the nails in His hands and feet so they could witness for themselves that this was the Christ. Similarly, many faithful people we have studied in the New Testament this year had anxiously awaited Christs coming. Then they stepped from their fields, workbenches, and dinner tables and followed Him, pressed upon Him, thronged Him, and sat with Him. Are we as anxious to witness for ourselves as the multitudes in the scriptures? Are the blessings we seek less needful than theirs?\n\nWhen Christ physically visited the Nephites at their temple, His invitation was not to stand at a distance and look upon Him, but to touch Him, to feel for themselves the reality of the Savior of humankind. How can we draw close enough to gain a personal witness of Jesus Christ? This may be part of what my father was trying to teach me. While we may not enjoy the same physical proximity as those who walked with Christ during His earthly ministry, through the Holy Ghost we can experience His power every day! As much as we need!\n\nThe young women around the world have taught me so much about seeking Christ and gaining a daily, personal witness of Him. Let me share the wisdom of two of them:\n\nLivvy has watched general conference her entire life. In fact, in her home they traditionally watch all five sessions as a family. In the past, conference for Livvy had meant doodling or drifting into the occasional unintended nap. But this past October general conference was different. It became personal.\n\nThis time, Livvy decided to be an active recipient. She silenced notifications on her phone and took notes of impressions from the Spirit. She was amazed as she felt specific things God wanted her to hear and do. This decision made a difference in her life almost immediately.\n\nJust days later her friends invited her to an inappropriate movie. She reflected, I felt the words and spirit of conference return into my heart, and I heard myself declining their invitation. She also had the courage to share her testimony of the Savior in her ward.\n\nAfter these events she stated, The amazing thing is, when I heard myself testify that Jesus is the Christ, I felt the Holy Ghost confirm it again for me.\n\nLivvy did not skip like a stone over the surface of conference weekend; she dove in, mind and spirit, and found the Savior there.\n\nAnd then there is Maddy. When her family stopped attending church, Maddy was confused and not certain what to do. She realized something significant was missing. So at age 13, Maddy began attending church alone. Even though being alone was sometimes hard and uncomfortable, she knew she could find the Savior at church and she wanted to be where He was. She said, In church my soul felt like it was at home.\n\nMaddy held onto the fact that her family had been sealed together for eternity. She started bringing her younger brothers with her to church and studying scriptures with them at home. Eventually her mom began joining them. Maddy told her mom of her desire to serve a mission and asked if her mom could be ready to attend the temple with her.\n\nToday Maddy is in the MTC. She is serving. She is witnessing of Christ. Her example helped lead both of her parents back to the temple and back to Christ.\n\nLike Livvy and Maddy, as we choose to seek Christ, the Spirit will witness of Him in many different situations. These witnesses of the Spirit occur as we fast, pray, wait, and continue forward. Our closeness to Christ grows through worshipping frequently in the temple, repenting daily, studying scriptures, attending church and seminary, pondering our patriarchal blessings, worthily receiving ordinances, and honoring sacred covenants. All of these invite the Spirit to enlighten our minds, and they bring added peace and protection. But do we honor them as sacred opportunities to testify of Christ?\n\nI have attended the temple many times, but when I worship in the house of the Lord, it changes me. Sometimes while fasting, I find myself simply going hungry, but other times, I feast on the Spirit with purpose. I sometimes have mumbled prayers that are repetitive and routine, but I have also come eager to receive counsel from the Lord through prayer.\n\nThere is power in making these holy habits less of a checklist and more of a witness. The process will be gradual but will grow with daily, active participation and purposeful experiences with Christ. As we consistently act on His teaching, we gain a testimony of Him; we build a relationship with Him and our Heavenly Father. We begin to become like Them.\n\nThe adversary creates so much noise that it can be difficult to hear the Lords voice. Our world, our challenges, our circumstances will not get quieter, but we can and must hunger and thirst after the things of Christ to hear Him with clarity. We want to create muscle memory of discipleship and testimony that will bring into focus our reliance on our Savior each day.\n\nMy father has been gone for over 11 years now, but his words are alive in me. Bonnie, never give up an opportunity to testify of Christ. I invite you to join me in accepting his invitation. Look for Christ everywhereI promise He is there! True joy rests on our willingness to come closer to Christ and witness for ourselves.\n\nWe know that in the last days, every knee shall bow, and every tongue confess that Jesus is the Christ. I pray this witness will become a normal and natural experience for us nowthat we will take every opportunity to joyfully testify: Jesus Christ lives!\n\nOh, how I love Him. How grateful we are for His infinite Atonement, which has made eternal life a possibility and immortality a reality for [us] all. I testify of our Saviors goodness and great glory in His sacred name, even Jesus Christ, amen."

          "text": "My dear brothers and sisters, lately I have been reflecting on three powerful truths from the Restoration. These truths have profoundly blessed my life. Today, I would like to share with you how these truths have guided me on my journey toward a sure witness of the gospel of Jesus Christ.\n\nHe is omniscient and omnipotent. Through the Light of Christ and the ministration of the Holy Ghost, His influence is everywhere. It is in His nature to bless us.\n\nHe sees our past, present, and eternal destiny. Nothing can be hidden from Him.\n\nPresident RussellM. Nelsons invitation to think celestial encourages us to emulate our Heavenly Fathers vision and nature.\n\nBecause of His divine attributes, our Heavenly Father gives us every good gift, each with His eternal perspective and vision in mind.\n\nIt is also the responsibility to choose well.\n\nJesus Christ paid the ultimate price for that privilege with His precious blood.\n\nSometimes we might believe that agency means doing whatever we want. But the fact that the price was paid means agency is a sacred gift.\n\nWe are agents, and agents are responsible for something. In this case, we are responsible for the choices we make based on the knowledge we have and the gifts we are given. We cannot make a choice without being responsible for the consequences.\n\nWhy do we have agency?\n\nTo choose good.\n\nTo choose Christ.\n\nTo choose eternal lifeagain and again.\n\nA witness from the Holy Ghost is greater than sight. He is the preeminent witness of the Father and the Son. President Nelson taught, In coming days, it will not be possible to survive spiritually without the guiding, directing, comforting, and constant influence of the Holy Ghost.\n\nBrothers and sisters, this is why we each need the power of the Holy Ghost today.\n\nA testimony through the Holy Ghost can come in many ways. Like a light bulb in a dark room, it can come on dramatically and suddenly. It can come like the sunrise gradually and over time. It can come like rays of light, intermittent exposure to pure intelligence. Whatever the way, it comes through the Holy Ghost.\n\nI grew up in beautiful Jamaica; it was fun and wonderful. However, when I started high school, some classmates and friends could not understand my decision to be a member of the Church of Jesus Christ. How could you join that church? they would ask. How could you believe that story?referring to the First Vision. How could you read that book?referring to the Book of Mormon. Do you really believe all that? And Why are you wasting your life away?\n\nIt was painful, especially when it came from people I cared about.\n\nBut what they didnt know was this: I had an experience with the Holy Ghost. As that testimony filled my heart, it dulled the pain of days, and for one brief moment, heavens view [appeared] before my gaze.\n\nPerhaps you have been asked some of these questions. Perhaps even now you are being bombarded as I was.\n\nThe gift and witness of the Holy Ghost are available to everyone.\n\nJamaica is to me like Palmyra was to Joseph Smith. It is my Sacred Grove. I do not know the exact spot where Joseph knelt to pray in the Sacred Grove, but I know exactly where I was when my Sacred Grove became a reality. It happened at Four Grove Road, Mandeville, Jamaica, in my bathroom, at 6:00 a.m. on a Wednesday three years after my baptism. This sacred experience happened because two weeks earlier an inspired sister missionary invited me to read the Book of Mormon. Sister Audrey Krauss is attending this conference today with her family, and I forever love her.\n\nThat experience changed me.\n\nBrothers and sisters, a testimony is not given for temporary use. This gift from our loving Heavenly Father is meant to be eternal because the giver is eternal. A testimony should not have an expiration date. It should not weaken or diminish because something in my life has changed or something in the world has changed. It should get stronger because, like the servants talents in the parable of the talents, my personal testimony is a gift to be multipliednot buried.\n\nLooking back on those difficult days of testing and persecution that I went through as a child has helped me get to the place where I now know for myself. I not only believe, hope, or trust, even though these are significant particles of faith on the pathway to a sure witness. I commend you for making your own way by asking questions, studying, praying, fasting, and pondering. Please dont stop. It is worth every effort to pursue this path to testimony. Who or what will you allow to take that away? What greater witness can you have than from God?\n\nEvery son or daughter of God can gain a deeper, firmer, and surer knowledge for themselves. Like Joseph Smith, who affirmed his testimony despite opposition, we can boldly say, I knew it, and I knew that God knew it, and I could not deny it, neither dared I do it.\n\nMy dear brothers and sisters, let the small seedling of testimony work in you until it springs up to an everlastingly glorious sure knowledge.\n\nIf you are a baptized and confirmed member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints but still struggle with I am not sure if I know, please remember this promise in the sacrament prayer: That they may always have his Spirit to be with them. Because of this promise, each of us can pursue the path to testimony and a sure knowledge.\n\nNow here is a grand truth: In whatever way a testimony is givenwhether it is distilled like the sunrise or comes in a glorious visionit still requires a choice to receive this precious gift.\n\nSaying I choose to believe makes it easier to receive a witness from God. If we find our testimony weakening, remember that it is the choices we make that diminish the power of the testimony. But the testimony has not gone anywhere. We just need to choose to reconnect with it.\n\nChoosing to believe is a wise and powerful way to use our agency.\n\nI cannot see a better way to use my agency than in defense of my testimony.\n\nPresident Nelson taught: I plead with you to take charge of your testimony. Work for it. Own it. Care for it. Nurture it so that it will grow. Feed it truth.\n\nTo me, the words take charge, work, care, own, nurture, and feed sound like an agent given stewardship for something precious and important.\n\nIn the early Church, ParleyP. Pratt felt disgruntled with the Prophet Joseph Smith and chose to criticize him and the Church. When John Taylor, whom Parley taught the gospel, came to town, Parley took him aside and warned him not to follow Joseph. John Taylor said to Parley:\n\nBefore you left Canada, you bore a strong testimony to Joseph Smith being a prophet of God, and you said you knew these things by revelation and the gift of the Holy Ghost.\n\nI now have the same testimony that you then rejoiced in. If the work was true six months ago, it is true today. If Joseph Smith was then a prophet, he is now a prophet.\n\nI testify that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God and that the prophetic mantle he received continues today. Jesus Christ directs this work.\n\nI invite you to think about your path to a sure witness of Jesus Christ and His gospel. Take charge of your testimony; use your agency wisely and acknowledge the giver and all His glorious attributes. I bear witness that the power is within you. No one can choose for you. No one can take this gift away. You can choose to believe.\n\nI promise that as you do this, your testimony will be a well of living water, springing up unto everlasting life. It will be an anchor and a motivator, and it will sustain you through difficult times. It will enable you to develop spiritual gifts. It will help you in your personal ministry and service. It will be a weapon against Satan and your adversaries. Your testimony will be a joy as you see it replicated in your children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren and in those you love and serve. It will be powerful when you share it and use it to testify.\n\nIf you know, you know. I know that I know. We need more sure witnesses of Jesus Christ and His gospel. Get there! Seek it! It is urgent! This is the final dispensationthe dispensation of the fulness of times.\n\nJesus Christ declared this truth: Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.\n\nBrothers and sisters, a testimony of Jesus Christ was never meant to be a temporary gift. Nothing about it is temporarynot the giver, not the gift itself, not the deliverer of the gift, not who the gift is about. May your testimony be described in this same way. Though heaven and earth shall pass away, your testimony and witness of the gospel of Jesus Christ will not pass away. Now is the time to lay hold on this precious gift. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen."

          "text": "My father used to tell me, Dont focus so intensely on your problems that you cant see the solution.\n\nI testify that the Lord Jesus Christ is the solution to even our most difficult problems. Specifically, He has overcome four problems that every one of us faces and that not one of us can solve on our own:\n\nThe first problem is physical death. We can try to delay it or ignore it, but we cant overcome it on our own. Jesus Christ, however, overcame death for us, and as a consequence, we will all be resurrected one day.\n\nThe second problem includes the tribulations, difficult experiences, sadness, pain, and unfairness of this world. Jesus Christ overcame all of this. For those who strive to follow Him, He will one day wipe away all tears and make things right again. In the meantime, He can strengthen us to pass through our trials with confidence, good cheer, and peace.\n\nThe third problem is spiritual death arising from sin. Jesus Christ overcame this problem by taking upon Himself the chastisement of our peace. Because of His atoning sacrifice, we can be freed from the consequences of our sins if we have faith in the Savior, sincerely repent, accept the covenant the Father offers us through essential ordinances such as baptism, and endure to the end.\n\nThe fourth problem is our limited, imperfect natures. Jesus Christ has the solution to this problem too. He doesnt just erase our errors and make us innocent again. He can work a mighty change in our hearts, that we have no more disposition to do evil, but to do good continually. We can be perfected by the grace of Christ and one day become like Him.\n\nUnfortunately, too often we concentrate so much on our own problems that we lose focus on the solution, our Savior, Jesus Christ. How do we avoid that mistake? I believe the answer lies in the covenants we are invited to make with Him and our Father in Heaven.\n\nOur covenants help us focus our attention, our thoughts, and our actions on Christ. As we cleave unto the covenants [we have] made, we can more easily identify the things of this world that we should lay aside and the things of a better [world] we should diligently seek.\n\nThats what the people of Ammon did in the Book of Mormon. As they learned of Jesus Christ and began to focus their lives on Him, they recognized that they should bury their weapons of war and became perfectly honest and distinguished for their zeal towards God.\n\nCovenant keeping leads us to seek after whatever invites the influence of the Spirit and reject whatever drives it awayfor we know that if we can be worthy of the presence of the Holy Ghost, we can also be worthy to live in the presence of Heavenly Father and His Son, Jesus Christ. This may mean that we have to change our vocabulary, using kinder words. It could mean replacing spiritually unhealthy habits with new habits that strengthen our relationship with the Lord, such as daily prayer and scripture study, individually and with our family.\n\nPresident RussellM. Nelson said that each person who makes covenants in baptismal fonts and in templesand keeps themhas increased access to the power of Jesus Christ.\n\nThe reward for keeping covenants with God is heavenly powerpower that strengthens us to withstand our trials, temptations, and heartaches better.\n\nRenewing our covenants during the sacrament each Sunday is a great opportunity to examine ourselves and refocus our lives on Jesus Christ. By partaking of the sacrament, we declare that we do always remember him. The word always is so significant. It extends the Saviors influence into every part of our lives. We dont remember Him only at church or only during our morning prayers or only when were in trouble and we need something.\n\nYes, we sometimes get distracted. We forget. We lose our focus. But renewing our covenants means that we want to always remember the Savior, that we will try to do so throughout the week, and that we will recommit and refocus on Him again at the sacrament table next week.\n\nClearly, focusing on Jesus Christ must be more than a Sunday, at-church activity. When President Nelson introduced Come, Follow Me in 2018, he said, It is time for a home-centered Church. He said we should transform [our] home into a sanctuary of faith and a center of gospel learning. And he made four wonderful promises to us if we do.\n\nThe first promise: Your Sabbath days will truly be a delight. It will become a day when we draw closer to our Savior. As a young woman from Peru said, The Lords day is the day I get the most answers from the Lord.\n\nThe second promise: Your children will be excited to learn and to live the Saviors teachings. That is why we talk of Christ, we rejoice in Christ, we preach of Christ, that our children may know to what source they may look for a remission of their sins.\n\nWe do this so that one day, when our son goes out to work or to hike in the mountains or to hunt beasts in the forests, as Enos did, he may remember what we taught him about Christ and about the joy of living the gospel. And who knows? Maybe this will be the day when he will finally feel the spiritual hunger that turns him to Jesus Christ so he can hear the voice of the Lord saying to him, Thy sins are forgiven thee, and thou shalt be blessed.\n\nThe third promise: The influence of the adversary in your life and in your home will decrease. Why? Because the more we focus on Jesus Christ, the more sin loses its appeal. As our homes are filled with the Saviors light, there is less and less room for the darkness of the adversary.\n\nThe fourth promise: Changes in your family will be dramatic and sustaining. Why? Because the change that Jesus Christ brings is a mighty change. He changes our very natures; we become new creatures. We gradually become more like the Savior, filled with His pure love for all of Gods children.\n\nWho wouldnt want these promises fulfilled in their lives and in their families? What do we need to do to obtain them? The answer is to transform our homes into a sanctuary of faith and a center of gospel learning. And how do we do that? By focusing on Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ, making Them the center of our family life, the most important influence in our home.\n\nCould I suggest that you begin by making the words of Christ, found in the scriptures, a daily part of your life? There is no prescribed formula for perfect scripture study. It could be 5 or 10 minutes each dayor more if you can. It could be a chapter or a few verses a day. Some families prefer to study in the morning before they leave for school or work. Others prefer to read at night before bed. Some young couples have told me that they study individually on the way to work and then share insights with each other via text so their comments and discussions are recorded.\n\nCome, Follow Me provides many suggestions of activities and resources that can help individuals and families learn gospel principles from the scriptures. The Bible videos and the Book of Mormon videos can also be valuable tools to make the scriptures more accessible to your family. Youth and children are often inspired by the memorable stories in the scriptures. These stories and the gospel principles they teach will stay with your children, like trusted friends, when they need good examples of service, virtue, obedience, patience, perseverance, personal revelation, charity, humility, and faith in Jesus Christ. Over time, your consistency in feasting on the word of God will help your children grow closer and closer to the Savior. They will come to know Him as never before.\n\nThe Lord Jesus Christ lives today. He can be an active, daily presence in our lives. He is the solution to our problems, but we must lift our eyes and raise our sights to see Him. He has said, Look unto me in every thought; doubt not, fear not. As we focus on Him and our Father in Heaven, make and keep covenants with Them, and make Them the most important influence in our home and family, we will become the kind of people President Nelson envisioned: A people who are able, ready, and worthy to receive the Lord when He comes again, a people who have already chosen Jesus Christ over this fallen world, a people who rejoice in their agency to live the higher, holier laws of Jesus Christ. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen."

          "text": "While on a business flight several years ago, I found myself seated next to a man from the Netherlands. I was eager to visit with him since I had served in Belgium and the Netherlands as a young missionary.\n\nAs we became acquainted, he gave me his business card with the unique job title of professor of happiness. I commented on his amazing profession and asked him what a professor of happiness did. He said he taught people how to have a happy life by establishing meaningful relationships and goals. I replied, Thats wonderful, but what if you could also teach how those relationships can continue beyond the grave and answer other questions of the soul, such as what is the purpose of life, how can we overcome our weaknesses, and where do we go after we die? He admitted that it would be amazing if we had the answers to those questions, and I was pleased to share with him that we do.\n\nToday, I would like to review a few essential principles for true happiness that seem to elude so many in this confusing world, where many things are interesting but few are truly important.\n\nAlma taught the people of his day, For behold, I say unto you there be many things to come; and behold, there is one thing which is of more importance than they allfor behold, the time is not far distant that the Redeemer liveth and cometh among his people.\n\nThis declaration is equally important to us today as we anticipate and prepare for Christs Second Coming!\n\nTherefore, my first observation is that building upon the foundation of Jesus Christ is essential to our happiness. This is a sure foundation, a foundation whereon if men build they cannot fall. Doing so prepares us for the challenges of life, come what may.\n\nMany years ago, I went to a summer Scout camp with our son Justin. As the activities got underway, he excitedly announced that he and his friends wanted to earn the archery merit badge. Doing so required the boys to pass a short written test and hit a target with their arrows.\n\nMy heart sank. At the time, Justin was quite frail due to cystic fibrosis, a disease he had been battling since birth. I wondered if he could pull the bow back far enough to send the arrow to the target.\n\nAs he and his friends left for the archery class, I silently prayed that he would not be humiliated by the experience. A couple of anxious hours later, I saw him coming up the path toward me with a big smile. Dad! he exclaimed. I got the merit badge! I got a bulls-eye; it was on the target next to mine, but I hit a bulls-eye! He had pulled the bow back with all his might and let the arrow fly, unable to control its trajectory. How grateful I am for that understanding archery instructor who never said, Sorry, wrong target! Rather, upon seeing Justins obvious limitations and earnest effort, he kindly responded, Good job!\n\nThat is how it will be for us if we do our very best to follow Christ and His prophets in spite of our limitations. If we come unto Him by keeping our covenants and repenting of our sins, we will joyfully hear our Saviors commendation: Well done, thou good and faithful servant.\n\nI bear you my witness of the divinity of the Savior of the world and of His redemptive love and power to heal, strengthen, and lift us when we are earnestly striving to come unto Him. Conversely, there is no way we can move with the crowd and also toward Jesus. The Savior has defeated death, disease, and sin and has provided a way for our ultimate perfection if we will follow Him with all of our hearts.\n\nMy second observation is that it is crucial to our happiness that we remember that we are sons and daughters of a loving Heavenly Father. Knowing and trusting this reality changes everything.\n\nSeveral years ago, on a flight home from a Church assignment, Sister Sabin and I found ourselves seated directly behind a very large man who had a big, angry face tattooed on the back of his bald head as well as the number 439.\n\nWhen we landed, I said, Excuse me, sir. Do you mind if I ask the significance of the number tattooed on the back of your head? I didnt dare ask about the angry face.\n\nHe said, Thats me. Thats who I am. I own that territory: 219!\n\nFour hundred and thirty-nine was the actual number on his head, so I was surprised he got it wrong since it was so important to him.\n\nI thought how sad it was that this mans identity and self-esteem were based on a number associated with a gang territory. I thought to myself: This tough-looking man was once someones little boy who still needed to feel valued and to belong. If only he knew who he really was and to whom he really belonged, for we have all been bought with a price.\n\nThere is a wise line in a song from the film The Prince of Egypt that states, Look at your life through heavens eyes. As the knowledge of our divine lineage and eternal potential sinks deep into our souls, we will be able to view life as a purposeful, unfolding adventure to learn and grow from, even as we see through a glass, darkly, for a short season.\n\nThe third hallmark for happiness is to always remember the worth of a soul. We do this best by following the Saviors admonition: Love one another; as I have loved you.\n\nHe also taught, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.\n\nThe book of Proverbs wisely counsels, Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power of thine hand to do it.\n\nWe will never regret being too kind. In Gods eyes, kindness is synonymous with greatness. Part of being kind is being forgiving and nonjudgmental.\n\nMany years ago our young family was going to see a movie for family home evening. We were all in the van except for one of our sons and my wife, Valerie. It was dark outside, and as our son threw open the door and ran toward the car, he accidentally kicked what he thought was our cat on the porch. Unfortunately for our son and my wife, who was right behind him, it was not our cat but rather a very unhappy skunk, who let them know it! We all returned to the house, where they both showered and washed their hair with tomato juice, the supposed sure remedy to eliminate the skunk odor. By the time they had cleaned up and changed their clothes, we were all desensitized to any odor, so we decided we were OK to go to the movie after all.\n\nOnce we were seated at the back of the theater, one by one the people around us suddenly decided to go out to get popcorn. When they came back, however, no one returned to their original seat.\n\nWe have laughed as weve recalled that experience, but what if all of our sins had an odor? What if we could smell dishonesty, lust, envy, or pride? With our own weaknesses revealed, we would hopefully be a little more considerate and careful of others and, likewise, they with us as we make the needed changes in our lives. I actually love the smell of tobacco in church because it indicates someone is trying to change. They need our welcoming arms around them.\n\nPresident RussellM. Nelson has wisely said, One of the easiest ways to identify a true follower of Jesus Christ is how compassionately that person treats other people.\n\nPaul wrote to the Ephesians, And be yekindone to another, tenderhearted, forgivingone another, even as God for Christs sake hath forgiven you.\n\nAs disciples of Jesus Christ, we are asked to trust Heavenly Father and our Savior and not attempt to replace Them. Jesus Christ knows everyones imperfections perfectly and will judge them perfectly.\n\nMy fourth happiness hallmark is to maintain an eternal perspective. Our Fathers plan stretches into the eternities; it is easy to focus on the here and now and forget the hereafter.\n\nI was taught this lesson powerfully a number of years ago by our then-16-year-old daughter, Jennifer. She was about to have a double lung transplant, where the five diseased lobes of her lungs would be completely removed and replaced by two healthy smaller lobes, donated by two amazing Christlike friends. It was a very high-risk procedure, yet the night before her surgery, Jennifer almost preached to me with all of her 90pounds (41kg), saying, Dont worry, Dad! Tomorrow I will wake up with new lungs, or I will wake up in a better place. Either way will be great. That is faith; that is eternal perspective! Seeing life from an eternal vantage point provides clarity, comfort, courage, and hope.\n\nAfter the surgery, when the long-awaited day came to remove the breathing tube and turn off the ventilator that had been helping Jennifer breathe, we anxiously waited to see if her two smaller lobes would work. When she took her first breath, she immediately started crying. Seeing our concern, she quickly exclaimed, Its just so good to breathe.\n\nEver since that day, I have thanked Heavenly Father morning and night for my ability to breathe. We are surrounded by innumerable blessings that we can easily take for granted if we are not mindful. Conversely, when nothing is expected and everything is appreciated, life becomes magical.\n\nPresident Nelson has said: Each new morning is a gift from God. Even the air we breathe is a loving loan from Him. He preserves us from day to day and supports us from one moment to another. Therefore, our first noble deed of the morning should be a humble prayer of gratitude.\n\nThat brings me to my fifth and final observation, which is you will never be happier than you are grateful.\n\nThe Lord declared, And he who receiveth all things with thankfulness shall be made glorious. Perhaps this is because gratitude gives birth to a multitude of other virtues.\n\nHow our awareness would change if every morning we awoke with only the blessings we were grateful for the night before. Failure to appreciate our blessings can result in a sense of dissatisfaction, which can rob us of the joy and happiness that gratitude engenders. Those in the great and spacious building entice us to look beyond the mark, thereby missing the mark entirely.\n\nIn reality, the greatest happiness and blessing of mortality will be found in who we have become through Gods grace as we make and keep sacred covenants with Him. Our Savior will polish and refine us through the merits of His atoning sacrifice and has said of those who willingly follow Him, They shall be mine in that day when I shall come to make up my jewels.\n\nI promise you that if we build our lives upon the foundation of Jesus Christ; value our true identity as sons and daughters of God; remember the worth of a soul; maintain an eternal perspective; and gratefully appreciate our many blessings, especially Christs invitation to come unto Him, we can find the true happiness we seek during this mortal adventure. Life will still have its challenges, but we will be able to better face each with a sense of purpose and peace because of the eternal truths we understand and live by.\n\nI bear you my witness of the reality of God, our loving Father, and of His Beloved Son, Jesus Christ. I also testify of living prophets, seers, and revelators. What a blessing it is to receive the counsel of heaven through them. As the Savior clearly stated, Whether by mine own voice or by the voice of my servants, it is the same. In the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen."

Medical statistics indicate I will probably depart mortality earlier than I ever expected, leaving behind, for a season, a family who means everything to me.\n\nRegardless of where you live, physical or emotional suffering from a variety of trials and mortal weaknesses has been, is now, or will someday be part of your life.\n\nPhysical suffering can result from natural aging, unexpected diseases, and random accidents; hunger or homelessness; or abuse, violent acts, and war.\n\nEmotional suffering can arise from anxiety or depression; the betrayal of a spouse, parent, or trusted leader; employment or financial reversals; unfair judgment by others; the choices of friends, children, or other family members; abuse in its many forms; unfulfilled dreams of marriage or children; the severe illness or early death of loved ones; or so many other sources.\n\nHow can you possibly endure the unique and sometimes debilitating suffering that comes to each of us?\n\nGratefully, hope is found in the gospel of Jesus Christ, and hope can also be part of your life. Today I share four principles of hope drawn from scripture, prophetic teachings, many ministering visits, and my own ongoing health trial. These principles are not just broadly applicable but also deeply personal.\n\nFirst, suffering does not mean God is displeased with your life. Two thousand years ago, Jesuss disciples saw a blind man at the temple and asked, Master, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind?\n\nHis disciples seemed to incorrectly believe, as do far too many people today, that all hardship and suffering in life are the result of sin. But the Savior replied, Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.\n\nThe work of God is to bring to pass our immortality and eternal life. But how can trials and sufferingespecially suffering imposed by another persons sinful use of agencyultimately advance Gods work?\n\nThe Lord told His covenant people, I have refined thee; I have chosen thee in the furnace of affliction. Whatever the cause of your sufferings, your loving Heavenly Father can direct them to refine your soul. Refined souls can bear others burdens with true empathy and compassion. Refined souls who have come out of great tribulation are prepared to joyfully live in Gods presence forever, and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.\n\nSecond, Heavenly Father is intimately aware of your suffering. While in the midst of trials, we can mistakenly think that God is far away and unconcerned with our pain. Even the Prophet Joseph Smith expressed this feeling at a low point in his life. When imprisoned in Liberty Jail while thousands of Latter-day Saints were being driven from their homes, Joseph sought understanding through prayer: O God, where art thou? And where is the pavilion that covereth thy hiding place? He ended with this plea: Remember thy suffering saints, O our God.\n\nThe Lords answer reassured Joseph and all who suffer:\n\nMy son, peace be unto thy soul; thine adversity and thine afflictions shall be but a small moment;\n\nAnd then, if thou endure it well, God shall exalt thee on high.\n\nMany suffering Saints have shared with me how they felt Gods love during their trials. I vividly recall my own experience at one point in my cancer battle when the doctors had not yet diagnosed the cause of some severe pain. I sat with my wife, intending to offer a routine blessing on our lunch. Instead, all I could do was simply weep, Heavenly Father, please help me. I am so sick. For the next 20 to 30 seconds, I was encircled in His love. I was given no reason for my illness, no indication of the ultimate outcome, and no relief from the pain. I just felt of His pure love, and that was and is enough.\n\nI witness that our Heavenly Father, who notes the fall of even a single sparrow, is aware of your suffering.\n\nThird, Jesus Christ offers His enabling power to help you have strength to endure your suffering well. This enabling power is made possible through His Atonement. I fear that too many Church members think if they are just a little tougher, they can get through any suffering on their own. This is a hard way to live. Your temporary moment of strength can never compare to the Saviors infinite supply of power to fortify your soul.\n\nThe Book of Mormon teaches that Jesus Christ would take upon him our pains, sicknesses, and infirmities so He can succor us. How can you draw upon the power that Jesus Christ offers to succor you and strengthen you in times of suffering? The key is binding yourself to the Savior by keeping the covenants you have made with Him. We make these covenants as we receive priesthood ordinances.\n\nThe people of Alma entered into the covenant of baptism. Later they suffered in bondage and were forbidden to worship publicly or even pray aloud. Yet they kept their covenants the best they could by crying out silently in their hearts. As a result, divine power came. The Lord did strengthen them that they could bear up their burdens with ease.\n\nIn our day, the Savior invites, Look unto me in every thought; doubt not, fear not. When we keep our sacrament covenant to always remember Him, He promises that His Spirit will be with us. The Spirit gives us strength to endure trials and do what we cannot possibly do on our own. The Spirit can heal us, although as President JamesE. Faust taught, Some of the healing may take place in another world.\n\nWe are also blessed by temple covenants and ordinances, where the power of godliness is manifest. I visited a woman who had lost a teenage daughter in a terrible accident, then later her husband to cancer. I asked how she could endure such loss and suffering. She replied that strength came from spiritual reassurances of an eternal family, received during regular temple worship. As promised, the ordinances of the Lords house had armed her with Gods power.\n\nFourth, choose to find joy each day. Those who suffer often feel that the night just goes on and on, and daylight will never come. It is OK to weep. Yet, if you find yourself in dark nights of suffering, by choosing faith you can awake to bright mornings of rejoicing.\n\nFor example, I visited a young mother being treated for cancer, smiling majestically in her chair despite the pain and a lack of hair. I met a middle-aged couple happily serving as youth leaders though they were unable to conceive children. I sat with a dear womana young grandmother, mother, and wifewho would pass away within days, yet amid the familys tears were laughter and joyful recollections.\n\nThese suffering Saints exemplify what President RussellM. Nelson has taught:\n\nThe joy we feel has little to do with the circumstances of our lives and everything to do with the focus of our lives.\n\nWhen the focus of our lives is on Gods plan of salvation  and Jesus Christ and His gospel, we can feel joy regardless of what is happeningor not happeningin our lives.\n\nI testify that our Heavenly Father remembers His suffering Saints, loves you, and is intimately aware of you. Our Savior knows how you feel. Surely he has borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows. I knowas a daily recipientthat keeping covenants unlocks the power of Jesus Christs atoning sacrifice to provide strength and even joy to you who suffer.\n\nFor all who suffer, I pray, May God grant unto you that your burdens may be light, through the joy of his Son. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen."

          "text": "Recently, while driving in a city unknown to us, I inadvertently took a wrong turn, which led my wife and me onto an express highway for endless miles without being able to turn around again. We had received a kind invitation to a friends home and worried that we would now arrive much later than we were expected to.\n\nWhile on this highway and desperately looking for a way out again, I blamed myself for not paying better attention to the navigation system. This experience caused me to think about how in our lives we sometimes make wrong decisions and how we must live with the consequences humbly and patiently until we are able to change our course again.\n\nLife is all about making choices. Our Father in Heaven gave us the divine gift of agency precisely so that we could learn from our choicesfrom the right ones and also from the wrong ones. We correct our wrong choices when we repent. This is where growth happens. Heavenly Fathers plan for all of us is about learning, developing, and progressing toward eternal life.\n\nEver since my wife and I were taught by the missionaries and joined the Church many years ago, I have always been impressed by the profound teachings that Lehi gave to his son Jacob in the Book of Mormon. He taught him that the Lord God gave unto man that he should act for himself and that it must needs be, that there is an opposition in all things. To be able to exercise our agency, we need to have opposing options to consider. In doing so, the Book of Mormon also reminds us that we have been instructed sufficiently and that the Spirit of Christ has been given to every one of us to know good from evil.\n\nIn life, we constantly confront many important choices. For example:\n\nChoosing whether or not we will follow Gods commandments.\n\nChoosing to have faith and recognize when miracles happen or to skeptically wait for something to happen before choosing to believe only then.\n\nChoosing to develop trust in God or to fearfully anticipate another challenge the next day.\n\nAs when I took a wrong turn on that highway, suffering from the consequences of our own poor decisions can often be especially painful because we only have ourselves to blame. Nevertheless, we can always choose to receive comfort through the divine process of repentance, make wrong things right again, and in doing so learn some life-changing lessons.\n\nSometimes we can also experience opposition and trials from things outside of our control, such as:\n\nMoments of health and periods of sickness.\n\nTimes of peace and times of war.\n\nHours of day and of night and seasons of summer and of winter.\n\nTimes of labor followed by times of rest.\n\nEven though we usually cannot choose between these kinds of situations because they just happen, we are still free to choose how to react to them. We can do so with a positive or with a pessimistic attitude. We can seek to learn from the experience and ask for our Lords help and support, or we can think that we are on our own in this trial and that we must suffer it alone. We can adjust our sails to the new reality, or we can decide not to change anything. In the darkness of night, we can turn on our lights. In the cold of winter, we should choose to wear warm clothes. In seasons of sickness, we can seek medical and spiritual help. We choose how to react to these circumstances.\n\nAdjust, learn, seek, choose are all action verbs. Remember that we are agents and not objects. Let us never forget that Jesus promised to take upon him the pains and sicknesses of his people  that he may  succor, or help, us as we turn to Him. We can choose to build our foundation on the rock that is Jesus Christ so that when the whirlwind comes, it shall have no power over [us]. He has promised that whosoever will come [to Him], him will [He] receive; and blessed are those who come unto [Him].\n\nNow, there is one additional principle that is especially important. Lehi said that there must needs be  an opposition in all things. This means that opposites dont exist apart from each other. They can even complement each other. We would not be able to identify joy unless we had also experienced sorrow at some point. Feeling hungry at times helps us to be especially grateful when we do have enough to eat again. We would not be able to identify truth unless we had also seen lies here and there.\n\nThese opposites are all like the two sides of one same coin. Both sides are always present. Charles Dickens provided an example of this idea when he wrote that it was the best of times, it was the worst of times.\n\nLet me give an example from our own life. Getting married, forming a family, and having children brought to us the greatest moments of joy we have ever experienced in our lives but also the most profound moments of pain, anguish, and grief when something happened to any one of us. Infinite joy and bliss with our children were sometimes also followed by recurring periods of sicknesses, hospitalizations, and sleepless nights filled with distress, as well as finding relief in prayers and priesthood blessings. These contrasting experiences taught us that we are never alone in moments of suffering, and they also showed us how much we can carry with the Lords succor and help. These experiences helped to shape us in wonderful ways, and it has all been totally worthwhile. Is this not what we came here for?\n\nIn the scriptures we also find some interesting examples:\n\nLehi taught his son Jacob that the afflictions he suffered in the wilderness helped him know the greatness of God and that [God] shall consecrate [his] afflictions for [his] gain.\n\nDuring Joseph Smiths cruel incarceration in Liberty Jail, the Lord told him that all these things shall give [him] experience, and shall be for [his] good.\n\nFinally, Jesus Christs infinite sacrifice was certainly the greatest example of pain and suffering ever seen, but it also brought about the wonderful blessings of His Atonement to all of Gods children.\n\nWhere there is sunshine, shadows must be there too. Floods can bring destruction, but they usually bring life as well. Tears of grief often turn into tears of relief and happiness. Feelings of sadness when loved ones depart are later compensated with the joy of meeting again. In periods of war and destruction, many little acts of kindness and love are also happening for those with eyes to see, and ears to hear.\n\nOur world today is often characterized by fear and anxietyfear of what the future might bring for us. But Jesus has taught us to trust and look unto [Him] in every thought; doubt not, fear not.\n\nLet us constantly make a very conscious effort to see both sides of every coin allotted to us in our lives. Even though both sides might sometimes not be immediately visible to us, we can know and trust that they are always there.\n\nWe can rest assured that our difficulties, sorrows, afflictions, and pains do not define us; rather, it is how we go about them that will help us grow and draw closer to God. It is our attitudes and choices that define us much better than our challenges.\n\nWhen in health, cherish and be grateful for it every moment. When in sickness, seek to patiently learn from it and know that this can change again according to Gods will. When in sorrow, trust that happiness is around the corner; we often just cannot see it yet. Consciously shift your focus and elevate your thoughts to the positive aspects of challenges, because they are undoubtedly always there too! Never forget to be grateful. Choose to believe. Choose to have faith in Jesus Christ. Choose to always trust God. Choose to think celestial, as President RussellM. Nelson recently taught us!\n\nLet us always be mindful of our Heavenly Fathers wonderful plan for us. He loves us and sent His Beloved Son to help in our trials and to open for us the door to return to Him. Jesus Christ lives and stands there at every moment, waiting for us to choose to call upon Him to provide succor, strength, and salvation. Of these things I testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen."

          "text": "In the final days of His mortal life, Jesus Christ told His Apostles of the persecutions and hardships they would suffer. He concluded with this great assurance: In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world (John 16:33). That is the Saviors message to all of our Heavenly Fathers children. That is the ultimate good news for each of us in our mortal lives.\n\nBe of good cheer was also a needed assurance in the world into which the resurrected Christ sent His Apostles. We are troubled on every side, the Apostle Paul later told the Corinthians, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair; persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed (2Corinthians 4:89).\n\nTwo thousand years later we are also troubled on every side, and we also need that same message not to despair but to be of good cheer. The Lord has special love and concern for His precious daughters. He knows of your wants, your needs, and your fears. The Lord is all powerful. Trust Him.\n\nThe Prophet Joseph Smith was taught that the works, and the designs, and the purposes of God cannot be frustrated, neither can they come to naught (Doctrine and Covenants 3:1). To His struggling children, the Lord gave these great assurances:\n\nBehold, this is the promise of the Lord unto you, O ye my servants.\n\nWherefore, be of good cheer, and do not fear, for I the Lord am with you, and will stand by you; and ye shall bear record of me, even Jesus Christ, that I am the Son of the living God (Doctrine and Covenants 68:56).\n\nThe Lord stands near us, and He has said:\n\nWhat I say unto one I say unto all, be of good cheer, little children; for I am in your midst, and I have not forsaken you (Doctrine and Covenants 61:36).\n\nFor after much tribulation come the blessings (Doctrine and Covenants 58:4).\n\nSisters, I testify that these promises, given in the midst of persecutions and personal tragedies, apply to each of you in your troubling circumstances today. They are precious and remind each of us to be of good cheer and to have joy in the fulness of the gospel as we press forward through the challenges of mortality.\n\nTribulation and challenges are the common experiences of mortality. Opposition is an essential part of the divine plan for helping us grow, and in the midst of that process, we have Gods assurance that, in the long view of eternity, opposition will not be allowed to overcome us. With His help and our faithfulness and endurance, we will prevail. Like the mortal life of which they are a part, all tribulations are temporary. In the controversies that preceded a disastrous war, United States president Abraham Lincoln wisely reminded his audience of the ancient wisdom that this, too, shall pass away.\n\nAs you know, the mortal adversities of which I speakwhich make it difficult to be of good cheersometimes come to us in common with many others, like the millions now struggling through some of the many devastating effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Similarly, in the United States millions are suffering through a season of enmity and contention that always seems to accompany presidential elections but this time is the most severe many of the oldest of us can ever remember.\n\nOn a personal basis, each of us struggles individually with some of the many adversities of mortality, such as poverty, racism, ill health, job losses or disappointments, wayward children, bad marriages or no marriages, and the effects of sinour own or others.\n\nYet, in the midst of all of this, we have that heavenly counsel to be of good cheer and to find joy in the principles and promises of the gospel and the fruits of our labors. That counsel has always been so, for prophets and for all of us. We know this from the experiences of our predecessors and what the Lord said to them.\n\nRemember the circumstances of the Prophet Joseph Smith. Looked at through the lens of adversities, his life was one of poverty, persecution, frustration, family sorrows, and ultimate martyrdom. As he suffered imprisonment, his wife and children and the other Saints suffered incredible hardships as they were driven out of Missouri.\n\nWhen Joseph pleaded for relief, the Lord answered:\n\nMy son, peace be unto thy soul; thine adversity and thine afflictions shall be but a small moment;\n\nAnd then, if thou endure it well, God shall exalt thee on high; thou shalt triumph over all thy foes (Doctrine and Covenants 121:78).\n\nThis was the personal, eternal counsel that helped the Prophet Joseph to maintain his native cheery temperament and the love and loyalty of his people. These same qualities strengthened the leaders and pioneers who followed and can strengthen you as well.\n\nThink of those early members! Again and again, they were driven from place to place. Finally they faced the challenges of establishing their homes and the Church in a wilderness. Two years after the initial band of pioneers arrived in the valley of the Great Salt Lake, the pioneers grip on survival in that hostile area was still precarious. Most members were still on the trail across the plains or struggling to get resources to do so. Yet leaders and members were still of hope and good cheer.\n\nEven though the Saints were not settled in their new homes, at October 1849 general conference a new wave of missionaries was sent out to Scandinavia, France, Germany, Italy, and the South Pacific. At what could have been thought their lowest level, the pioneers rose to new heights. And just three years later, another 98 were also called to begin to gather scattered Israel. One of the Church leaders explained that these missions are generally, not to be very long ones; probably from 3 to 7 years will be as long as any man will be absent from his family.\n\nSisters, the First Presidency is concerned about your challenges. We love you and pray for you. At the same time, we often give thanks that our physical challengesapart from earthquakes, fires, floods, and hurricanesare usually less than our predecessors faced.\n\nIn the midst of hardships, the divine assurance is always be of good cheer, for I will lead you along. The kingdom is yours and the blessings thereof are yours, and the riches of eternity are yours (Doctrine and Covenants 78:18). How does this happen? How did it happen for the pioneers? How will it happen to women of God today? By our following prophetic guidance, the gates of hell shall not prevail against [us], the Lord said by revelation in April 1830. Yea, He said, the Lord God will disperse the powers of darkness from before you, and cause the heavens to shake for your good, and his names glory (Doctrine and Covenants 21:6). Fear not, little flock; do good; let earth and hell combine against you, for if ye are built upon my rock, they cannot prevail (Doctrine and Covenants 6:34).\n\nWith the Lords promises, we lift up [our] heart[s] and rejoice (Doctrine and Covenants 25:13), and with a glad heart and a cheerful countenance (Doctrine and Covenants 59:15), we go forward on the covenant path. Most of us do not face decisions of giant proportions, like leaving our homes to pioneer an unknown land. Our decisions are mostly in the daily routines of life, but as the Lord has told us, Be not weary in well-doing, for ye are laying the foundation of a great work. And out of small things proceedeth that which is great (Doctrine and Covenants 64:33).\n\nThere is boundless power in the doctrine of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ. Our unshakable faith in that doctrine guides our steps and gives us joy. It enlightens our minds and gives strength and confidence to our actions. This guidance and enlightenment and power are promised gifts we have received from our Heavenly Father. By understanding and conforming our lives to that doctrine, including the divine gift of repentance, we can be of good cheer as we keep ourselves on the path toward our eternal destinyreunion and exaltation with our loving heavenly parents.\n\nYou may be facing overwhelming challenges, Elder RichardG. Scott taught. Sometimes they are so concentrated, so unrelenting, that you may feel they are beyond your capacity to control. Dont face the world alone. Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding [Proverbs 3:5].  It was intended that life be a challenge, not so that you would fail, but that you might succeed through overcoming.\n\nIt is all part of the plan of God the Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, of which I testify, as I pray that we will all persist to our heavenly destination, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen."

          "text": "Heavenly Fathers plan of happiness includes a mortal experience where all of His children will be tested and face trials. Five years ago I was diagnosed with cancer. I have felt and still feel the physical pains from surgeries, radiation treatments, and medication side effects. I have experienced emotional struggles during torturous sleepless nights. Medical statistics indicate I will probably depart mortality earlier than I ever expected, leaving behind, for a season, a family who means everything to me.\n\nRegardless of where you live, physical or emotional suffering from a variety of trials and mortal weaknesses has been, is now, or will someday be part of your life.\n\nPhysical suffering can result from natural aging, unexpected diseases, and random accidents; hunger or homelessness; or abuse, violent acts, and war.\n\nEmotional suffering can arise from anxiety or depression; the betrayal of a spouse, parent, or trusted leader; employment or financial reversals; unfair judgment by others; the choices of friends, children, or other family members; abuse in its many forms; unfulfilled dreams of marriage or children; the severe illness or early death of loved ones; or so many other sources.\n\nHow can you possibly endure the unique and sometimes debilitating suffering that comes to each of us?\n\nGratefully, hope is found in the gospel of Jesus Christ, and hope can also be part of your life. Today I share four principles of hope drawn from scripture, prophetic teachings, many ministering visits, and my own ongoing health trial. These principles are not just broadly applicable but also deeply personal.\n\nFirst, suffering does not mean God is displeased with your life. Two thousand years ago, Jesuss disciples saw a blind man at the temple and asked, Master, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind?\n\nHis disciples seemed to incorrectly believe, as do far too many people today, that all hardship and suffering in life are the result of sin. But the Savior replied, Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.\n\nThe work of God is to bring to pass our immortality and eternal life. But how can trials and sufferingespecially suffering imposed by another persons sinful use of agencyultimately advance Gods work?\n\nThe Lord told His covenant people, I have refined thee; I have chosen thee in the furnace of affliction. Whatever the cause of your sufferings, your loving Heavenly Father can direct them to refine your soul. Refined souls can bear others burdens with true empathy and compassion. Refined souls who have come out of great tribulation are prepared to joyfully live in Gods presence forever, and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.\n\nSecond, Heavenly Father is intimately aware of your suffering. While in the midst of trials, we can mistakenly think that God is far away and unconcerned with our pain. Even the Prophet Joseph Smith expressed this feeling at a low point in his life. When imprisoned in Liberty Jail while thousands of Latter-day Saints were being driven from their homes, Joseph sought understanding through prayer: O God, where art thou? And where is the pavilion that covereth thy hiding place? He ended with this plea: Remember thy suffering saints, O our God.\n\nThe Lords answer reassured Joseph and all who suffer:\n\nMy son, peace be unto thy soul; thine adversity and thine afflictions shall be but a small moment;\n\nAnd then, if thou endure it well, God shall exalt thee on high.\n\nMany suffering Saints have shared with me how they felt Gods love during their trials. I vividly recall my own experience at one point in my cancer battle when the doctors had not yet diagnosed the cause of some severe pain. I sat with my wife, intending to offer a routine blessing on our lunch. Instead, all I could do was simply weep, Heavenly Father, please help me. I am so sick. For the next 20 to 30 seconds, I was encircled in His love. I was given no reason for my illness, no indication of the ultimate outcome, and no relief from the pain. I just felt of His pure love, and that was and is enough.\n\nI witness that our Heavenly Father, who notes the fall of even a single sparrow, is aware of your suffering.\n\nThird, Jesus Christ offers His enabling power to help you have strength to endure your suffering well. This enabling power is made possible through His Atonement. I fear that too many Church members think if they are just a little tougher, they can get through any suffering on their own. This is a hard way to live. Your temporary moment of strength can never compare to the Saviors infinite supply of power to fortify your soul.\n\nThe Book of Mormon teaches that Jesus Christ would take upon him our pains, sicknesses, and infirmities so He can succor us. How can you draw upon the power that Jesus Christ offers to succor you and strengthen you in times of suffering? The key is binding yourself to the Savior by keeping the covenants you have made with Him. We make these covenants as we receive priesthood ordinances.\n\nThe people of Alma entered into the covenant of baptism. Later they suffered in bondage and were forbidden to worship publicly or even pray aloud. Yet they kept their covenants the best they could by crying out silently in their hearts. As a result, divine power came. The Lord did strengthen them that they could bear up their burdens with ease.\n\nIn our day, the Savior invites, Look unto me in every thought; doubt not, fear not. When we keep our sacrament covenant to always remember Him, He promises that His Spirit will be with us. The Spirit gives us strength to endure trials and do what we cannot possibly do on our own. The Spirit can heal us, although as President JamesE. Faust taught, Some of the healing may take place in another world.\n\nWe are also blessed by temple covenants and ordinances, where the power of godliness is manifest. I visited a woman who had lost a teenage daughter in a terrible accident, then later her husband to cancer. I asked how she could endure such loss and suffering. She replied that strength came from spiritual reassurances of an eternal family, received during regular temple worship. As promised, the ordinances of the Lords house had armed her with Gods power.\n\nFourth, choose to find joy each day. Those who suffer often feel that the night just goes on and on, and daylight will never come. It is OK to weep. Yet, if you find yourself in dark nights of suffering, by choosing faith you can awake to bright mornings of rejoicing.\n\nFor example, I visited a young mother being treated for cancer, smiling majestically in her chair despite the pain and a lack of hair. I met a middle-aged couple happily serving as youth leaders though they were unable to conceive children. I sat with a dear womana young grandmother, mother, and wifewho would pass away within days, yet amid the familys tears were laughter and joyful recollections.\n\nThese suffering Saints exemplify what President RussellM. Nelson has taught:\n\nThe joy we feel has little to do with the circumstances of our lives and everything to do with the focus of our lives.\n\nWhen the focus of our lives is on Gods plan of salvation  and Jesus Christ and His gospel, we can feel joy regardless of what is happeningor not happeningin our lives.\n\nI testify that our Heavenly Father remembers His suffering Saints, loves you, and is intimately aware of you. Our Savior knows how you feel. Surely he has borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows. I knowas a daily recipientthat keeping covenants unlocks the power of Jesus Christs atoning sacrifice to provide strength and even joy to you who suffer.\n\nFor all who suffer, I pray, May God grant unto you that your burdens may be light, through the joy of his Son. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen."

          "text": "Last June, a terrible accident occurred in the country of Lesotho in southern Africa. A small bus carrying 20 young women of the Maputsoe Branch of the Church and seven of their leaders was headed to the capital city, Maseru, for a gathering of young women from their district. As they traveled the two-lane highway in the morning hours, a car coming in the opposite direction, attempting to pass another vehicle, came into the lane occupied by the bus. There was no space or time to avoid a head-on collision, and within seconds the vehicles hit, rolled off the road, and burst into flames.\n\nIn all, 15 people died in the accident, including six young women, two Young Women leaders, and the branch president and his wife. Survivors, family members, and friends have expressed a range of emotions, including moments of anger, depression, and even guilt. Despite these feelings and unanswered questions, they have comforted one another and turned to God through sacred music, the scriptures, and prayer, where they have found solace. Seventeen-year-old survivor Setsoana Selebeli testified, Jesus Christ loves us and is with us, even though our hearts hurt.\n\nA young woman and a leader who were hospitalized for burn treatments studied the Book of Mormon together. One said, Lately weve been reading in Moroni, and Moroni says exactly what Ive been feeling.  When he speaks, its like hes saying, You have to learn these words because they are written for you to help you pass through this.\n\nAt a joint funeral service for those who perished, Area Seventy Elder Siyabonga Mkhize counseled, We should all turn to the Lord at this time and ask Him to comfort our hearts and  to soothe the pain that we feel. The Young Women president from the neighboring Leribe Branch, Mampho Makura, urged: Turn to the Lord, and find the strength to accept His will. Jesus Christ is the author and finisher of our faith [Hebrews 12:2]. Dont look away, but look to Him.\n\nLook to Him. Her words echo the counsel of Alma to his son Helaman: See that ye look to God and live. Alma cited the experience of Lehi and his people with the Liahona as a type: It is as easy to give heed to the word of Christ, which will point to you a straight course to eternal bliss, as it was for our fathers to give heed to this compass, which would point unto them a straight course to the promised land. Alma said: If they would look they might live.  And if we  look we may live forever.\n\nOn another occasion, Alma cited the example of the brass serpent raised by Moses when the ancient Israelites were afflicted by fiery serpents. The Lord told Moses to make a figure of a serpent and lift it on a pole, with the promise that every one that is bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live. Alma explained that the brass figure was a type or symbol of Christ, who would be lifted up upon the cross. Many did look and live, but others were, in Almas words, so hardened that they simply would not look and perished.\n\nAlma asked:\n\nIf ye could be healed by merely casting about your eyes that ye might be healed, would ye not behold quickly, or would ye rather harden your hearts in unbelief, and be slothful, that ye would not cast about your eyes, that ye might perish?\n\nThen cast about your eyes and begin to believe in the Son of God, that he will come to redeem his people, and that he shall suffer and die to atone for their sins; and that he shall rise again from the dead, which shall bring to pass the resurrection, that all men shall stand before him, to be judged at the last and judgment day, according to their works.\n\nOf course, the counsel look to God and live not only has meaning for us in eternity but also makes all the difference in the character and quality of our mortal lives. Remember the words of young Sister Selebeli in Lesotho already mentionedJesus Christ loves us and is with us, even though our hearts hurt.\n\nIt is in the nature of a fallen worldwhere the devil rages and where everyone is imperfectthat there will be disappointments and offenses, suffering and sorrow, failure and loss, persecution and injustice. It is only by looking to God that individuals, families, and even nations can flourish. President RussellM. Nelson taught, Because the Savior, through His infinite Atonement, redeemed each of us from weakness, mistakes, and sin, and because He experienced every pain, worry, and burden you have ever had [see Alma 7:1113], then as you truly repent and seek His help, you can rise above this present precarious world.\n\nNo promise is repeated more often in Book of Mormon scripture than this: Inasmuch as ye shall keep my commandments ye shall prosper in the land; but inasmuch as ye will not keep my commandments ye shall be cut off from my presence. The lived experience of the Book of Mormon peoples over centuries demonstrates the truth of these words. Prosper meant enjoying the guidance and blessings of heaven in their lives. Prosper meant achieving levels of economic well-being that enabled them to marry, raise families, and minister to the needs of others. Prospering included the capacity to rise above hardship and trial. Through the grace of Christ, all things work[ed] together for [their] good, refined them, and deepened their relationship with Him.\n\nAlma explained that to look to God is to keep His commandments, cry unto Him continually for His support, counsel with Him in all your doings, and let your heart be full of thanks unto Him day and night. Gods commandments and counsel are found in the scriptures and the words of His servants. The principles and ideals laid out in The Family: A Proclamation to the World are a prime example. Another is the guidance found in the booklet For the Strength of Youth. The Young Men and Young Women theme for this year is Look unto Christ, drawn from the Lords comforting direction to Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery: Look unto me in every thought; doubt not, fear not. For the Strength of Youth speaks to several of Gods most urgent commandments and standards and teaches how to look to the Lord in making good decisions. It is a guide not only for youth but for all of us.\n\nAs one very important example, For the Strength of Youth has crucial guidance in the chapter titled Your Body Is Sacred. It instructs: Treat your bodyand others bodieswith respect. As you make decisions about your clothing, hairstyle, and appearance, ask yourself, Am I honoring my body as a sacred gift from God?\n\nFor the Strength of Youth further states: Keep sex and sexual feelings sacred. They should not be the subject of jokes or entertainment. Outside of marriage between a man and a woman, it is wrong to touch the private, sacred parts of another persons body even if clothed. In your choices about what you do, look at, read, listen to, think about, post, or text, avoid anything that purposely arouses lustful emotions in others or yourself.\n\nThis calls to mind President Nelsons recent admonition:\n\nFew things will complicate your life more quickly than violating this divine law [of chastity]. For those who have made covenants with God, immorality is one of the quickest ways to lose your testimony.\n\nThe power to create life is the one privilege of godhood that Heavenly Father allows His mortal children to exercise. Thus, God set clear guidelines for the use of this living, divine power. Physical intimacy is only for a man and a woman who are married to each other.\n\nMuch of the world does not believe this, but public opinion is not the arbiter of truth. The Lord has declared that no unchaste person will attain the celestial kingdom.  If you have been unchaste, I plead with you to repent. Come unto Christ and receive His promise of complete forgiveness as you fully repent of your sins [see Isaiah 1:1618; Doctrine and Covenants 58:4243].\n\nRemember that in the Book of Mormon promise, the opposite of prosperity was not povertyit was being cut off from the presence of the Lord. His presence refers to the influence of His Spirit in ones life. All are imbued with the Light of Christ as they come into the world. In addition, some act to be baptized and receive the gift and added light of the Holy Ghost. He brings inspiration and guidance, enhances and refines ones native gifts and abilities, and helps to avoid evil influences, poor decisions, and dead ends.\n\nLike you, I know some who once enjoyed the gift of the Holy Ghost but who through failure to keep the commandments of God have lost that blessing. One in particular comes to mind whose membership in the Church had been withdrawn due to transgression. He said that his initial reaction was to feel offended. He felt judged by imperfect leaders. He knew his conduct had been wrong, but he rationalized it by pointing to the faults and failings of others. After a while, he began to feel comfortable in a lifestyle outside the Church without the obligation of callings and expectations of attending worship services and ministering to others.\n\nThis continued for some time, but he began to feel ever more keenly the absence of the Holy SpiritGods presencein his life. By experience, he knew what it was like to have, day by day, the comfort, guidance, and confidence born of the Spirit, and he missed it. Finally, he did what was needed to repent and qualify once more for baptism of water and of the Spirit.\n\nThere seems to be no end to the different sources people look to for meaning, happiness, and help. Most are looking beyond the mark. But we need not be children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine [or fashion]. In looking to God, we can find peace in difficulty, and our faith can continue to grow even in times of doubt and spiritual challenge. We can receive strength in the face of opposition and isolation. We can reconcile the ideal with the present reality. Truly, there is no other way than what God Himself has ordained: Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth: for I am God, and there is none else.\n\nLooking to God means that He is not just one of our priorities; it means, rather, that He is our one highest priority. I call to mind again that awful crash in Lesotho last June. From her hospital bed, one of the Young Women leaders who survived, who did not believe in God before joining the Church, said that her purpose is now to discover why her life was spared. Constantly serving God is how I will come to an answer, if I come to an answer, she stated. I used to think that I love God, but now I really, really, really, really, really love Him. Now He is the [number-one] priority in my life.\n\nI bear testimony of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, who in perfect unity of word, thought, purpose, and action are the one God, to whom we may look for all good things. I bear testimony of the Atonement of Jesus Christ, whence comes the power to fulfill this wonderful promise: Look unto me, and endure to the end, and ye shall live; for unto him that endureth to the end will I give eternal life. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen."

          "text": "My father used to tell me, Dont focus so intensely on your problems that you cant see the solution.\n\nI testify that the Lord Jesus Christ is the solution to even our most difficult problems. Specifically, He has overcome four problems that every one of us faces and that not one of us can solve on our own:\n\nThe first problem is physical death. We can try to delay it or ignore it, but we cant overcome it on our own. Jesus Christ, however, overcame death for us, and as a consequence, we will all be resurrected one day.\n\nThe second problem includes the tribulations, difficult experiences, sadness, pain, and unfairness of this world. Jesus Christ overcame all of this. For those who strive to follow Him, He will one day wipe away all tears and make things right again. In the meantime, He can strengthen us to pass through our trials with confidence, good cheer, and peace.\n\nThe third problem is spiritual death arising from sin. Jesus Christ overcame this problem by taking upon Himself the chastisement of our peace. Because of His atoning sacrifice, we can be freed from the consequences of our sins if we have faith in the Savior, sincerely repent, accept the covenant the Father offers us through essential ordinances such as baptism, and endure to the end.\n\nThe fourth problem is our limited, imperfect natures. Jesus Christ has the solution to this problem too. He doesnt just erase our errors and make us innocent again. He can work a mighty change in our hearts, that we have no more disposition to do evil, but to do good continually. We can be perfected by the grace of Christ and one day become like Him.\n\nUnfortunately, too often we concentrate so much on our own problems that we lose focus on the solution, our Savior, Jesus Christ. How do we avoid that mistake? I believe the answer lies in the covenants we are invited to make with Him and our Father in Heaven.\n\nOur covenants help us focus our attention, our thoughts, and our actions on Christ. As we cleave unto the covenants [we have] made, we can more easily identify the things of this world that we should lay aside and the things of a better [world] we should diligently seek.\n\nThats what the people of Ammon did in the Book of Mormon. As they learned of Jesus Christ and began to focus their lives on Him, they recognized that they should bury their weapons of war and became perfectly honest and distinguished for their zeal towards God.\n\nCovenant keeping leads us to seek after whatever invites the influence of the Spirit and reject whatever drives it awayfor we know that if we can be worthy of the presence of the Holy Ghost, we can also be worthy to live in the presence of Heavenly Father and His Son, Jesus Christ. This may mean that we have to change our vocabulary, using kinder words. It could mean replacing spiritually unhealthy habits with new habits that strengthen our relationship with the Lord, such as daily prayer and scripture study, individually and with our family.\n\nPresident RussellM. Nelson said that each person who makes covenants in baptismal fonts and in templesand keeps themhas increased access to the power of Jesus Christ.\n\nThe reward for keeping covenants with God is heavenly powerpower that strengthens us to withstand our trials, temptations, and heartaches better.\n\nRenewing our covenants during the sacrament each Sunday is a great opportunity to examine ourselves and refocus our lives on Jesus Christ. By partaking of the sacrament, we declare that we do always remember him. The word always is so significant. It extends the Saviors influence into every part of our lives. We dont remember Him only at church or only during our morning prayers or only when were in trouble and we need something.\n\nYes, we sometimes get distracted. We forget. We lose our focus. But renewing our covenants means that we want to always remember the Savior, that we will try to do so throughout the week, and that we will recommit and refocus on Him again at the sacrament table next week.\n\nClearly, focusing on Jesus Christ must be more than a Sunday, at-church activity. When President Nelson introduced Come, Follow Me in 2018, he said, It is time for a home-centered Church. He said we should transform [our] home into a sanctuary of faith and a center of gospel learning. And he made four wonderful promises to us if we do.\n\nThe first promise: Your Sabbath days will truly be a delight. It will become a day when we draw closer to our Savior. As a young woman from Peru said, The Lords day is the day I get the most answers from the Lord.\n\nThe second promise: Your children will be excited to learn and to live the Saviors teachings. That is why we talk of Christ, we rejoice in Christ, we preach of Christ, that our children may know to what source they may look for a remission of their sins.\n\nWe do this so that one day, when our son goes out to work or to hike in the mountains or to hunt beasts in the forests, as Enos did, he may remember what we taught him about Christ and about the joy of living the gospel. And who knows? Maybe this will be the day when he will finally feel the spiritual hunger that turns him to Jesus Christ so he can hear the voice of the Lord saying to him, Thy sins are forgiven thee, and thou shalt be blessed.\n\nThe third promise: The influence of the adversary in your life and in your home will decrease. Why? Because the more we focus on Jesus Christ, the more sin loses its appeal. As our homes are filled with the Saviors light, there is less and less room for the darkness of the adversary.\n\nThe fourth promise: Changes in your family will be dramatic and sustaining. Why? Because the change that Jesus Christ brings is a mighty change. He changes our very natures; we become new creatures. We gradually become more like the Savior, filled with His pure love for all of Gods children.\n\nWho wouldnt want these promises fulfilled in their lives and in their families? What do we need to do to obtain them? The answer is to transform our homes into a sanctuary of faith and a center of gospel learning. And how do we do that? By focusing on Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ, making Them the center of our family life, the most important influence in our home.\n\nCould I suggest that you begin by making the words of Christ, found in the scriptures, a daily part of your life? There is no prescribed formula for perfect scripture study. It could be 5 or 10 minutes each dayor more if you can. It could be a chapter or a few verses a day. Some families prefer to study in the morning before they leave for school or work. Others prefer to read at night before bed. Some young couples have told me that they study individually on the way to work and then share insights with each other via text so their comments and discussions are recorded.\n\nCome, Follow Me provides many suggestions of activities and resources that can help individuals and families learn gospel principles from the scriptures. The Bible videos and the Book of Mormon videos can also be valuable tools to make the scriptures more accessible to your family. Youth and children are often inspired by the memorable stories in the scriptures. These stories and the gospel principles they teach will stay with your children, like trusted friends, when they need good examples of service, virtue, obedience, patience, perseverance, personal revelation, charity, humility, and faith in Jesus Christ. Over time, your consistency in feasting on the word of God will help your children grow closer and closer to the Savior. They will come to know Him as never before.\n\nThe Lord Jesus Christ lives today. He can be an active, daily presence in our lives. He is the solution to our problems, but we must lift our eyes and raise our sights to see Him. He has said, Look unto me in every thought; doubt not, fear not. As we focus on Him and our Father in Heaven, make and keep covenants with Them, and make Them the most important influence in our home and family, we will become the kind of people President Nelson envisioned: A people who are able, ready, and worthy to receive the Lord when He comes again, a people who have already chosen Jesus Christ over this fallen world, a people who rejoice in their agency to live the higher, holier laws of Jesus Christ. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen."

          "text": "Mistakes are a fact of life. Learning to skillfully play the piano is essentially impossible without making thousands of mistakesmaybe even a million. To learn a foreign language, one must face the embarrassment of making thousands of mistakesmaybe even a million. Even the worlds greatest athletes never stop making mistakes.\n\nSuccess, it has been said, isnt the absence of failure, but going from failure to failure without any loss of enthusiasm.\n\nWith his invention of the light bulb, Thomas Edison purportedly said, I didnt fail 1,000 times. The light bulb was an invention with 1,000 steps. CharlesF. Kettering called failures finger posts on the road to achievement. Hopefully, each mistake we make becomes a lesson in wisdom, turning stumbling blocks into stepping-stones.\n\nNephis unwavering faith helped him go from failure to failure until he finally obtained the brass plates. It took Moses 10 attempts before he finally found success in fleeing Egypt with the Israelites.\n\nWe may wonderif both Nephi and Moses were on the Lords errand, why didnt the Lord intervene and help them achieve success on their first try? Why did He allow themand why does He allow usto flounder and fail in our attempts to succeed? Among many important answers to that question, here are a few:\n\nFirst, the Lord knows that these things shall give [us] experience, and shall be for [our] good.\n\nSecond, to allow us to taste the bitter, that [we] may know to prize the good.\n\nThird, to prove that the battle is the Lords, and it is only by His grace that we can accomplish His work and become like Him.\n\nFourth, to help us develop and hone scores of Christlike attributes that cannot be refined except through opposition and in the furnace of affliction.\n\nSo, amid a life full of stumbling blocks and imperfection, we all are grateful for second chances.\n\nIn 1970, as a new freshman at BYU, I enrolled in a beginning course on the essentials of physics taught by Jae Ballif, an outstanding professor. After finishing each unit of the course, he would administer an exam. If a student received a C and wanted a better grade, Professor Ballif would allow the student to take a modified exam covering the same material. If the student received a B on the second attempt and was still unsatisfied, he or she could take the test a third time and a fourth, and so on. By allowing me numerous second chances, he helped me excel and finally earn an A in his class.\n\nHe was an uncommonly wise professor who inspired his students to keep tryingto consider failure as a tutor, not as a tragedy, and to not fear failure but to learn from it.\n\nRecently I telephoned this great man 47 years after taking his physics course. I asked him why he was willing to allow students unlimited attempts to improve their grade. His response: I wanted to be on the same side as the students.\n\nWhile we are grateful for second chances following mistakes, or failures of the mind, we stand all amazed at the Saviors grace in giving us second chances in overcoming sin, or failures of the heart.\n\nNo one is more on our side than the Savior. He allows us to take and keep retaking His exams. To become like Him will require countless second chances in our day-to-day struggles with the natural man, such as controlling appetites, learning patience and forgiveness, overcoming slothfulness, and avoiding sins of omission, just to name a few. If to err is human nature, how many failures will it take us until our nature is no longer human but divine? Thousands? More likely a million.\n\nKnowing that the strait and narrow path would be strewn with trials and that failures would be a daily occurrence for us, the Savior paid an infinite price to give us as many chances as it would take to successfully pass our mortal probation. The opposition which He allows can often seem insurmountable and almost impossible to bear, yet He doesnt leave us without hope.\n\nTo keep our hope resilient as we face lifes trials, the Saviors grace is ever ready and ever present. His grace is a divine means of help or strength,  an enabling power that allows men and women to lay hold on eternal life and exaltation after they have expended their own best efforts. His grace and His loving eye are upon us throughout our entire journey as He inspires, lightens burdens, strengthens, delivers, protects, heals, and otherwise succor[s] his people, even as they stumble along the strait and narrow path.\n\nRepentance is Gods ever-accessible gift that allows and enables us to go from failure to failure without any loss of enthusiasm. Repentance isnt His backup plan in the event we might fail. Repentance is His plan, knowing that we will. This is the gospel of repentance, and as President RussellM. Nelson has observed, it will be a lifetime curriculum.\n\nIn this lifetime curriculum of repentance, the sacrament is the Lords designated way of providing continual access to His forgiveness. If we partake with a broken heart and a contrite spirit, He proffers us weekly pardon as we progress from failure to failure along the covenant path. For notwithstanding their sins, my bowels are filled with compassion towards them.\n\nBut just how many times will He forgive us? How long is His long-suffering? On one occasion Peter asked the Savior, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven times?\n\nPresumably, Peter thought seven was a sufficiently high number to emphasize the folly of forgiving too many times and that benevolence should have its limits. In response, the Savior essentially told Peter to not even countto not establish limits on forgiveness.\n\nJesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven.\n\nObviously, the Savior was not establishing an upper limit of 490. That would be analogous to saying that partaking of the sacrament has a limit of 490, and then on the 491st time, a heavenly auditor intercedes and says, Im so sorry, but your repentance card just expiredfrom this point forward, youre on your own.\n\nThe Lord used the math of seventy times seven as a metaphor of His infinite Atonement, His boundless love, and His limitless grace. Yea, and as often as my people repent will I forgive them their trespasses against me.\n\nThat doesnt mean that the sacrament becomes a license to sin. Thats one reason this phrase was included in the book of Moroni: But as oft as they repented and sought forgiveness, with real intent, they were forgiven.\n\nReal intent implies with real effort and real change. Change is the principal word the Guide to the Scriptures uses to define repentance: A change of mind and heart that brings a fresh attitude toward God, oneself, and life in general. That kind of change results in spiritual growth. Our success, then, isnt going from failure to failure, but growing from failure to failure without any loss of enthusiasm.\n\nConcerning change, consider this simple insight: Things that dont change remain the same. This obvious truth isnt meant to insult your intelligence but is the profound wisdom of President BoydK. Packer, who then added, And when we are through changingwere through.\n\nBecause we dont want to be through until we become as our Savior is, we need to continue getting up each time we fall, with a desire to keep growing and progressing despite our weaknesses. In our weakness, He reassures us, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness.\n\nOnly with time-lapse photography or growth charts can we discern our physical growth. Likewise, our spiritual growth is usually imperceptible except through the rearview lens of time. It would be wise to regularly take an introspective look through that lens to recognize our progress and inspire us to press forward with a steadfastness in Christ, having a perfect brightness of hope.\n\nI am eternally grateful for the loving-kindness, patience, and long-suffering of Heavenly Parents and the Savior, who allow us countless second chances on our journey back to Their presence. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen."

          "text": "A few years ago, at a family gathering, my then-eight-year-old nephew William asked our oldest son, Briton, if he would like to play ball with him. Briton enthusiastically responded, Yes! I would love to! After they had been playing for quite some time, a ball got away from Briton, and he accidentally broke one of his grandparents antique pots.\n\nBriton felt awful. As he began picking up the broken pieces, William walked over to his cousin and lovingly patted him on the back. He then comforted, Dont worry, Briton. I broke something at Grandma and Grandpas house once, and Grandma put her arm around me and said, Its OK, William. You are only five.\n\nTo which Briton responded, But, William, Im 23!\n\nWe can learn much from the scriptures about how our Savior, Jesus Christ, will help us successfully navigate the things in our lives that are broken, no matter our age. He can heal broken relationships with God, broken relationships with others, and broken parts of ourselves.\n\nWhile the Savior was teaching in the temple, a woman was brought to Him by the scribes and Pharisees. We do not know her full story, just that she was taken in adultery. Often the scriptures give only a small portion of someones life, and based on that portion, we sometimes tend to exalt or condemn. No ones life can be understood by one magnificent moment or one regrettable public disappointment. The purpose of these scriptural accounts is to help us see that Jesus Christ was the answer then, and He is the answer now. He knows our complete story and exactly what we suffer, as well as our capabilities and vulnerabilities.\n\nChrists response to this precious daughter of God was Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more. Another way to say go, and sin no more could be go forth and change. The Savior was inviting her to repent: to change her behavior, her associations, the way she felt about herself, her heart.\n\nBecause of Christ, our decision to go forth and change can also allow us to go forth and heal, for He is the source of healing all that is broken in our lives. As the great Mediator and Advocate with the Father, Christ sanctifies and restores broken relationshipsmost important, our relationship with God.\n\nThe Joseph Smith Translation makes it clear that the woman did follow the Saviors counsel and changed her life: And the woman glorified God from that hour, and believed on his name. It is unfortunate that we do not know her name or other details about her life after this moment because it would have required great determination, humility, and faith in Jesus Christ for her to repent and change. What we do know is she was a woman who believed on his name with the understanding that she was not beyond the reach of His infinite and eternal sacrifice.\n\nIn Luke chapter 15 we read a parable of a man who had two sons. The younger son asked his father for his inheritance, took his journey into a far country, and wasted his substance with riotous living.\n\nAnd when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that land; and he began to be in want.\n\nAnd he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine.\n\nAnd he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat: and no man gave unto him.\n\nAnd when he came to himself, he said, How many hired servants of my fathers have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger!\n\nI will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee,\n\nAnd am no more worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired servants.\n\nAnd he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him.\n\nThe fact that the father ran to his son, I believe, is significant. The personal hurt that the son had inflicted upon his father was surely deep and profound. Likewise, the father may have been genuinely embarrassed by his sons actions.\n\nSo why didnt the father wait for his son to apologize? Why didnt he hold out for an offering of restitution and reconciliation before extending forgiveness and love? This is something I have often pondered.\n\nThe Lord teaches us that forgiving others is a universal commandment: I, the Lord, will forgive whom I will forgive, but of you it is required to forgive all men. Extending forgiveness can take tremendous courage and humility. It can also take time. It requires us to put our faith and trust in the Lord as we assume accountability for the condition of our hearts. Here lies the significance and power of our agency.\n\nWith the depiction of this father in the parable of the prodigal son, the Savior emphasized that forgiveness is one of the noblest gifts we can give one another and most specifically ourselves. Unburdening our hearts through forgiveness isnt always easy, but through the enabling power of Jesus Christ, it is possible.\n\nIn Acts chapter 3 we learn about a man who was born lame and whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called Beautiful, to ask alms of them that entered into the temple.\n\nThe lame beggar was over 40 years old and had spent his entire life in a seemingly never-ending state of wanting and waiting, for he was dependent on the generosity of others.\n\nOne day he saw Peter and John about to go into the temple [and] asked an alms.\n\nAnd Peter, fastening his eyes upon him with John, said, Look on us.\n\nAnd he gave heed unto them, expecting to receive something of them.\n\nThen Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk.\n\nAnd he took him by the right hand, and lifted him up: and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength.\n\nAnd he leaping up stood, and walked, and entered with them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God.\n\nOftentimes we can find ourselves, like the lame beggar at the gate of the temple, patientlyor sometimes impatientlywait[ing] upon the Lord. Waiting to be healed physically or emotionally. Waiting for answers that penetrate the deepest part of our hearts. Waiting for a miracle.\n\nWaiting upon the Lord can be a sacred placea place of polishing and refining where we can come to know the Savior in a deeply personal way. Waiting upon the Lord may also be a place where we find ourselves asking, O God, where art thou?a place where spiritual perseverance requires us to exercise faith in Christ by intentionally choosing Him again and again and again. I know this place, and I understand this type of waiting.\n\nI spent countless hours at a cancer treatment facility, united in my suffering with many who were yearning to be healed. Some lived; others did not. I learned in a profound way that deliverance from our trials is different for each of us, and therefore our focus should be less about the way in which we are delivered and more about the Deliverer Himself. Our emphasis should always be on Jesus Christ!\n\nExercising faith in Christ means trusting not only in Gods will but also in His timing. For He knows exactly what we need and precisely when we need it. When we submit to the will of the Lord, we will ultimately receive substantially more than that which we had desired.\n\nMy dear friends, we all have something in our lives that is broken that needs to be mended, fixed, or healed. As we turn to the Savior, as we align our hearts and minds with Him, as we repent, He comes to us with healing in his wings, puts His arms lovingly around us, and says, Its OK. You are only 5or 16, 23, 48, 64, 91. We can fix this together!\n\nI testify that there is nothing in your life that is broken that is beyond the curative, redeeming, and enabling power of Jesus Christ. In the sacred and holy name of He who is mighty to heal, Jesus Christ, amen."

He felt very strange; at first he lost control of his left arm; then his tongue went numb. The left side of his face began to droop. He had difficulty speaking. He knew something was wrong. What he didnt know was that he was in the middle of a massive stroke in three areas of his brain. Fear began to set in as he became partially paralyzed. How quickly a stroke victim receives care can have a dramatic effect on the extent of his healing. His faithful missionary companion acted decisively. After calling 911, he gave him a blessing. Miraculously, the ambulance was only five minutes away.\n\nAfter our son was rushed to the hospital, the medical personnel quickly assessed the situation and determined they should administer a medicine to our son that could potentially reverse the strokes paralyzing effects over time. However, if our son was not having a stroke, the medicine could have severe consequences, such as bleeding in the brain. Our son had to choose. He chose to accept the medication. While full recovery required more operations and many months, our son eventually returned and completed his mission after the effects of the stroke were substantially reversed.\n\nOur Heavenly Father is all-powerful and all-knowing. He knows our physical struggles. He is aware of our physical pains due to illness, disease, aging, accidents, or birth disorders. He is aware of emotional struggles associated with anxiety, loneliness, depression, or mental illness. He knows each person who has suffered injustice or who has been abused. He knows our weaknesses and the propensities and temptations we struggle with.\n\nDuring mortality we are tested to see if we will choose good over evil. For those who keep His commandments, they will live with Him in a state of never-ending happiness. To help us in our progression to become like Him, Heavenly Father has given all power and knowledge to His Son, Jesus Christ. There is no physical, emotional, or spiritual ailment that Christ cannot heal.\n\nFrom the mortal ministry of the Savior, the scriptures recount many miraculous events where Jesus Christ used His divine power to heal those who suffered physically.\n\nThe Gospel of John recounts the story of a certain man who had endured a debilitating infirmity for 38 years.\n\nWhen Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time in that case, he saith unto him, Wilt thou be made whole?\n\nThe impotent man responded that no one was around to help him when he needed it most.\n\nJesus saith unto him, Rise, take up thy bed, and walk.\n\nAnd immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and walked.\n\nPlease note the juxtaposition of how long this man suffered on his own38 yearsand how quickly the healing came once the Savior became involved. The healing was immediate.\n\nIn another instance, a woman with an issue of blood 12 years, who had spent all [of] her living upon physicians,  came behind him, and touched the border of his garment: and immediately her issue of blood [ceased].\n\nAnd Jesus said, Somebody hath touched me: for I perceive that virtue is gone out of me.\n\nAnd when the woman saw that she was not hid, she  declared unto him before all the people  how she was healed immediately.\n\nThrough His ministry, Christ taught that He had power over the physical body. We cannot control the timing of when Christs healing of our physical ailments will occur. Healing occurs according to His will and wisdom. In the scriptures, some suffered for decades; others, their entire mortal lives. Mortal infirmities can refine us and deepen our reliance upon God. But when we allow Christ to be involved, He will always strengthen us spiritually so we can have greater capacity to endure our burdens.\n\nUltimately, we know that every physical ailment, malady, or imperfection will be healed in the Resurrection. That is a gift to all mankind through the Atonement of Jesus Christ.\n\nJesus Christ can heal more than just our physical bodies. He can heal our spirits as well. Throughout scripture we learn how Christ helped those whose spirits were weak and made them whole. As we ponder these experiences, our hope and faith in the Saviors power to bless our lives increases. Jesus Christ can change our hearts, heal us from the effects of injustice or abuse we may experience, and strengthen our capacity to bear loss and heartache, bringing us peace to help us endure the trials of our lives, healing us emotionally.\n\nChrist can also heal us when we sin. We sin when we knowingly break one of Gods laws. When we sin, our soul becomes unclean. No unclean thing can dwell in Gods presence. Becoming clean from sin is [to be] healed spiritually.\n\nGod the Father knows we will sin, but He has prepared a way for us to be redeemed. Elder LynnG. Robbins taught: Repentance isnt [Gods] backup plan in the event we might fail. Repentance is His plan, knowing that we will. When we sin, we have the opportunity to choose the good from the evil. We choose the good when we repent after we have sinned. Through Jesus Christ and His atoning sacrifice, we can be redeemed from our sins and brought back to the presence of God the Father if we repent. Spiritual healing is not one-sidedit requires the Saviors redemptive power and sincere repentance on the part of the sinner. For those who choose not to repent, they are rejecting the healing Christ offers. For them, it is as though no redemption was made.\n\nAs I have counseled with others seeking to repent, I have marveled that people who were living in sin had difficulty making correct decisions. The Holy Ghost would leave them, and they often struggled to make choices that would bring them closer to God. They would wrestle for months or even years, embarrassed or frightened of the consequences of their sins. Often they felt that they could never change or be forgiven. I have often heard them share their fear that if their loved ones knew what they had done, they would stop loving them or leave them. When they followed this line of thinking, they resolved to just keep quiet and delay their repentance. They incorrectly felt that it was better not to repent now so that they would not further hurt those they loved. In their minds it was better to suffer after this life than go through the repentance process now. Brothers and sisters, it is never a good idea to procrastinate your repentance. The adversary often uses fear to prevent us from acting immediately upon our faith in Jesus Christ.\n\nWhen loved ones are confronted with the truth about sinful behavior, while they may feel deeply wounded, they often want to help the sincerely repentant sinner to change and to reconcile with God. Indeed, spiritual healing accelerates when the sinner confesses and is surrounded by those who love them and help them to forsake their sins. Please remember that Jesus Christ is mighty in how He also heals the innocent victims of sin who turn to Him.\n\nPresident BoydK. Packer stated: Our spirits are damaged when we make mistakes and commit sins. But unlike the case of our mortal bodies, when the repentance process is complete, no scars remain because of the Atonement of Jesus Christ. The promise is: Behold, he who has repented of his sins, the same is forgiven, and I, the Lord, remember them no more [Doctrine and Covenants 58:42].\n\nWhen we repent with full purpose of heart, immediately shall the great plan of redemption be brought about in our lives. The Savior will heal us.\n\nThe missionary companion and the medical professionals who helped our stroke-afflicted son in the mission field acted quickly. Our son chose to receive the stroke-reversing medicine. The paralyzing effects of his stroke that could have followed him for the remainder of his mortal life were reversed. Likewise, the faster we repent and bring the Atonement of Jesus Christ into our lives, the sooner we can be healed from the effects of sin.\n\nPresident RussellM. Nelson offered this invitation: If you have stepped off the path,  I invite you  to please come back. Whatever your concerns, whatever your challenges, there is a place for you in this, the Lords Church. You and generations yet unborn will be blessed by your actions now to return to the covenant path.\n\nOur spiritual healing requires us to submit ourselves to the conditions our Savior has outlined. We must not delay! We must act today! Act now so that spiritual paralysis does not prevent your eternal progression. While I have been speaking, if you have felt the need to ask forgiveness of someone you have wronged, I invite you to act. Tell them what you have done. Ask for their forgiveness. If you have committed a sin that impacts your temple worthiness, I invite you to counsel with your bishoptoday. Do not delay.\n\nMy brothers and sisters, God is our loving Father in Heaven. He has given all power and knowledge to His Beloved Son, Jesus Christ. Because of Him, all mankind will one day be healed of every physical ailment forever. Because of the Atonement of Jesus Christ, if we choose to repent and turn our hearts fully to the Savior, He will heal us spiritually. That healing can begin immediately. The choice is ours. Will we be made whole?\n\nI testify that Jesus Christ paid the price so that we can be made whole. But we must choose to take that healing medicine He offers. Take it today. Do not delay. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen."

          "text": "Since the beginning of this year, we have dealt with many unexpected events. The loss of life and income due to the worldwide pandemic has seriously affected the global community and economy.\n\nEarthquakes, fires, and floods in different parts of the world, as well as other weather-related disasters, have left people feeling helpless, hopeless, and brokenhearted, wondering if their lives will ever be the same.\n\nLet me tell you a personal story about brokenness.\n\nWhen our children were young, they decided they wanted to take piano lessons. My husband, Rudy, and I wanted to provide our children this opportunity, but we had no piano. We could not afford a new piano, so Rudy started looking for a used one.\n\nThat year for Christmas, he surprised us all with a piano, and through the years, our children learned to play.\n\nWhen our sons grew up and left the house, the old piano just collected dust, so we sold it. A few years went by, and we had saved some money. One day Rudy said, I think its time we get a new piano.\n\nI asked, Why would we get a new piano, when neither of us plays?\n\nHe said, Oh, but we can get a piano that plays itself! By using an iPad, you can program the piano to play over 4,000 songs, including hymns, Tabernacle Choir songs, all the Primary songs, and so many more.\n\nRudy is a great salesperson, to say the least.\n\nWe purchased a beautiful new player piano, and a few days later, two big, strong men delivered it to our house.\n\nI showed them where I wanted it and moved out of the way.\n\nIt was a heavy baby grand, and to fit it through the door, they removed the legs and managed to put the piano sideways on top of a moving dolly that they had brought with them.\n\nOur house sat on a little bit of a slope, and unfortunately earlier that day it had snowed, leaving things wet and slushy. Can you see where this is going?\n\nWhile the men were moving the piano up the little slope, it slipped, and I heard a big, loud crash. The piano had fallen off the moving dolly and hit the ground so hard that it left a big dent in our lawn.\n\nI said, Oh, my goodness. Are you OK?\n\nThankfully both men were OK.\n\nTheir eyes were wide as they looked at each other, then looked at me and said, We are so sorry. Well take it back to the store and have our manager call you.\n\nSoon the manager was talking with Rudy to arrange delivery of a new piano. Rudy is kind and forgiving and told the manager it was OK if they just repaired the damage and brought back the same piano, but the manager insisted on getting us a new one.\n\nRudy responded, saying, It couldnt be that bad. Just fix it up and bring it over.\n\nThe manager said, The wood is broken, and once the wood is broken, it can never sound the same. You will get a new piano.\n\nSisters and brothers, arent we all like this piano, a little broken, cracked, and damaged, feeling like we will never be the same again? However, as we come unto Jesus Christ by exercising faith in Him, repenting, and making and keeping covenants, our brokennesswhatever its causecan be healed. This process, which invites the Saviors healing power into our lives, does not just restore us to what we were before but makes us better than we ever were. I know that through our Savior, Jesus Christ, we can all be mended, made whole, and fulfill our purpose, just like a beautiful-sounding, brand-new piano.\n\nPresident RussellM. Nelson taught: When sore trials come upon us, its time to deepen our faith in God, to work hard, and to serve others. Then He will heal our broken hearts. He will bestow upon us personal peace and comfort. Those great gifts will not be destroyed, even by death.\n\nJesus said:\n\nCome unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.\n\nTake my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.\n\nFor my yoke is easy, and my burden is light (Matthew 11:2830).\n\nTo heal brokenness by coming unto Him, we need to have faith in Jesus Christ. Having faith in Jesus Christ means relying completely on Himtrusting in His infinite power  and love. It includes believing His teachings. It means believing that even though we do not understand all things, He does. Because He has experienced all our pains, afflictions, and infirmities, He knows how to help us rise above our daily difficulties.\n\nAs we come unto Him, we can be filled with joy, peace, and consolation. All that is [hard and challenging] about life can be made right through the Atonement of Jesus Christ. He has counseled us, Look unto me in every thought; doubt not, fear not (Doctrine and Covenants 6:36).\n\nIn the Book of Mormon when Alma and his people were nearly crushed by the burdens placed upon them, the people pleaded for relief. The Lord didnt take away their burdens; instead He promised them:\n\nAnd I will also ease the burdens which are put upon your shoulders, that even you cannot feel them upon your backs, even while you are in bondage; and this will I do that ye may stand as witnesses for me hereafter, and that ye may know of a surety that I, the Lord God, do visit my people in their afflictions.\n\nAnd now it came to pass that the burdens which were laid upon Alma and his brethren were made light; yea, the Lord did strengthen them that they could bear up their burdens with ease, and they did submit cheerfully and with patience to all the will of the Lord (Mosiah 24:1415).\n\nOf the Saviors ability to heal and lighten burdens, Elder TadR. Callister has taught:\n\nOne of the blessings of the Atonement is that we can receive of the Saviors succoring powers. Isaiah spoke repeatedly of the Lords healing, calming influence. He testified that the Savior was a strength to the needy in his distress, a refuge from the storm, a shadow from the heat (Isaiah 25:4). As to those who sorrow, Isaiah declared that the Savior possessed the power to comfort all that mourn (Isaiah 61:2), and wipe away tears from off all faces (Isaiah 25:8; see also Revelation 7:17); revive the spirit of the humble (Isaiah 57:15); and bind up the brokenhearted (Isaiah 61:1; see also Luke 4:18; Psalm 147:3). So expansive was his succoring power that he could exchange beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness (Isaiah 61:3).\n\nOh, what hope soars in those promises!  His spirit heals; it refines; it comforts; it breathes new life into hopeless hearts. It has the power to transform all that is ugly and vicious and worthless in life to something of supreme and glorious splendor. He has the power to convert the ashes of mortality to the beauties of eternity.\n\nI testify that Jesus Christ is our loving Savior, our Redeemer, the Master Healer, and our faithful friend. If we turn to Him, He will heal us and make us whole again. I testify this is His Church and He is preparing to return once again to reign with power and glory on this earth. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen."

          "text": "My dear sisters in the gospel of Jesus Christ, I greet you as divinely assigned guardians of the eternal family. President RussellM. Nelson has taught us, This Church was restored so that families could be formed, sealed, and exalted eternally. That teaching has important implications for persons who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender, commonly referred to as LGBT. President Nelson has also reminded us that we dont have to [always] agree with each other to love each other. These prophetic teachings are important for family discussions to answer the questions of children and youth. I have prayerfully sought inspiration to speak to this audience because you are uniquely affected by these questions, which directly or indirectly affect every family in the Church.\n\nI begin with what Jesus taught were the two great commandments.\n\nThou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.\n\nThis is the first and great commandment.\n\nAnd the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.\n\nThis means we are commanded to love everyone, since Jesuss parable of the good Samaritan teaches that everyone is our neighbor. But our zeal to keep this second commandment must not cause us to forget the first, to love God with all our heart, soul, and mind. We show that love by keep[ing] [His] commandments. God requires us to obey His commandments because only through that obedience, including repentance, can we return to live in His presence and become perfect as He is.\n\nIn his recent talk to the young adults of the Church, President RussellM. Nelson spoke of what he called the strong connection between Gods love and His laws. The laws that apply most significantly to the issues relating to those identifying as LGBT are Gods law of marriage and its companion law of chastity. Both are essential in our Father in Heavens plan of salvation for His children. As President Nelson taught, Gods laws are motivated entirely by His infinite love for us and His desire for us to become all we can become.\n\nPresident Nelson taught: Many countries  have legalized same-sex marriage. As members of the Church, we respect the laws of the land , including civil marriage. The truth is, however, that in the beginning  marriage was ordained by God! And to this day it is defined by Him as being between a man and a woman. God has not changed His definition of marriage.\n\nPresident Nelson continued: God has also not changed His law of chastity. Requirements to enter the temple have not changed.\n\nPresident Nelson reminded all of us that our commission as Apostles is to teach nothing but truth. That commission does not give [Apostles] the authority to modify divine law. Thus, my sisters, the leaders of the Church must always teach the unique importance of marriage between a man and a woman and the related law of chastity.\n\nThe work of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is ultimately concerned with preparing the children of God for the celestial kingdom, and most particularly for its highest glory, exaltation or eternal life. That highest destiny is possible only through marriage for eternity. Eternal life includes the creative powers inherent in the combination of male and femalewhat modern revelation describes as the continuation of the seeds forever and ever.\n\nIn his talk to young adults, President Nelson taught, Abiding by Gods laws will keep you safe as you progress toward eventual exaltationthat is, to become like God, with the exalted life and divine potential of our Heavenly Parents. That is the destiny we desire for all we love. Because of that love, we cannot let our love supersede the commandments and the plan and work of God, which we know will bring those we love their greatest happiness.\n\nBut there are many we love, including some who have the restored gospel, who do not believe in or choose not to follow Gods commandments about marriage and the law of chastity. What about them?\n\nGods doctrine shows that all of us are His children and that He has created us to have joy. Modern revelation teaches that God has provided a plan for a mortal experience in which all can choose obedience to seek His highest blessings or make choices that lead to one of the less glorious kingdoms. Because of Gods great love for all of His children, those lesser kingdoms are still more wonderful than mortals can comprehend. The Atonement of Jesus Christ makes all of this possible, as He glorifies the Father, and saves all the works of his hands.\n\nI have spoken of the first commandment, but what of the second? How do we keep the commandment to love our neighbors? We seek to persuade our members that those who follow lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender teachings and actions should be treated with the love our Savior commands us to show toward all our neighbors. Thus, when same-sex marriage was declared legal in the United States, the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve declared: The gospel of Jesus Christ teaches us to love and treat all people with kindness and civilityeven when we disagree. We affirm that those who avail themselves of laws or court rulings authorizing same-sex marriage should not be treated disrespectfully.\n\nFurther, we must never persecute those who do not share our beliefs and commitments. Regretfully, some persons facing these issues continue to feel marginalized and rejected by some members and leaders in our families, wards, and stakes. We must all strive to be kinder and more civil.\n\nFor reasons we do not understand, we have different challenges in our mortal experiences. But we do know that God will help each of us overcome these challenges if we sincerely seek His help. After suffering and repenting for violations of laws we have been taught, we are all destined for a kingdom of glory. The ultimate and final judgment will be by the Lord, who alone has the required knowledge, wisdom, and grace to judge each of us.\n\nMeanwhile, we must try to keep both of the great commandments. To do so, we walk a fine line between law and lovekeeping the commandments and walking the covenant path, while loving our neighbors along the way. This walk requires us to seek divine inspiration on what to support and what to oppose and how to love and listen respectfully and teach in the process. Our walk demands that we not compromise on commandments but show forth a full measure of understanding and love. Our walk must be considerate of children who are uncertain about their sexual orientation, but it discourages premature labeling because, in most children, such uncertainty decreases significantly over time. Our walk opposes recruitment away from the covenant path, and it denies support to any who lead people away from the Lord. In all of this we remember that God promises hope and ultimate joy and blessings for all who keep His commandments.\n\nMothers and fathers and all of us are responsible to teach both of the two great commandments. For the women of the Church, President SpencerW. Kimball described that duty in this great prophecy: Much of the major growth that is coming to the Church in the last days will come because many of the good women of the world  will be drawn to the Church in large numbers. This will happen to the degree that the women of the Church reflect righteousness and articulateness in their lives and to the degree that the women of the Church are seen as distinct and different  from the women of the world.  Thus it will be that female exemplars of the Church will be a significant force in both the numerical and the spiritual growth of the Church in the last days.\n\nSpeaking of that prophecy, President RussellM. Nelson declared that the day that President Kimball foresaw is today. You are the women he foresaw! Little did we who heard that prophecy 40 years ago realize that among those the women of this Church may save will be their own dear friends and family who are currently influenced by worldly priorities and devilish distortions. My prayer and blessing is that you will teach and act to fulfill that prophecy, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen."

          "text": "As a boy, I remember driving in the car with my father and seeing individuals on the roadside who had found themselves in difficult circumstances or who needed help. My father would always make the comment Pobrecito, which means poor little one.\n\nOn occasion, I watched with interest as my father would help many of these people, especially when we would travel to Mexico to see my grandparents. He would typically find someone in need and then go privately and provide the help they needed. I later discovered that he was helping them enroll in school, buy some food, or provide in some way or another for their well-being. He was ministering to a poor little one who came across his path. In fact, in my growing-up years I cannot remember a time when we did not have someone living with us who needed a place to stay as they became self-reliant. Watching these experiences created in me a spirit of compassion toward my fellow men and women and for those in need.\n\nIn Preach My Gospel it states: You are surrounded by people. You pass them on the street, visit them in their homes, and travel among them. They are all children of God, your brothers and sisters.  Many of these people are searching for purpose in life. They are concerned for their future and their families (Preach My Gospel: A Guide to Missionary Service [2018],1).\n\nThroughout the years, while serving in the Church, I have tried to seek after those who needed help in their lives, both temporally and spiritually. I would often hear the voice of my father saying, Pobrecito, poor little one.\n\nIn the Bible we find a wonderful example of caring for a poor little one:\n\nNow Peter and John went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer, being the ninth hour.\n\nAnd a certain man lame from his mothers womb was carried, whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called Beautiful, to ask alms of them that entered into the temple;\n\nWho seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple asked an alms.\n\nAnd Peter, fastening his eyes upon him with John, said, Look on us.\n\nAnd he gave heed unto them, expecting to receive something of them.\n\nThen Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk.\n\nAnd he took him by the right hand, and lifted him up: and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength (Acts 3:17; emphasis added).\n\nIn reading this account, I was intrigued by the use of the word fastening. The word fastening means to direct ones eyes or thoughts to or to look intently at (see fasten, Dictionary.com). As Peter looked at this man, he saw him differently than others. He looked past his inability to walk and his weaknesses and could discern that his faith was adequate to become healed and enter into the temple to receive the blessings he was seeking.\n\nI noticed that he took him by the right hand and lifted him up. As he assisted the man in this way, the Lord miraculously healed him, and his feet and ankle bones received strength (Acts 3:7). His love for this man and a desire to help him caused an increase of capacity and ability in the man who was weak.\n\nWhile serving as an Area Seventy, I reserved each Tuesday night to do ministering visits with the stake presidents in my area of responsibility. I invited them to make appointments with those who were in need of an ordinance of the gospel of Jesus Christ or who were not currently keeping the covenants they had made. Through our consistent and intentional ministering, the Lord magnified our efforts and we were able to find individuals and families who were in need. These were the poor little ones who lived in the different stakes where we served.\n\nOn one occasion, I accompanied President Bill Whitworth, the president of the Sandy Utah Canyon View Stake, to do ministering visits. He was prayerful about whom we should visit, trying to have the same experience as Nephi, who was led by the Spirit, not knowing beforehand the things which [he] should do (1Nephi 4:6). He demonstrated that as we minister, we should be led by revelation to those who are most in need, as opposed to just going down a list or visiting individuals in a methodical way. We should be led by the power of inspiration.\n\nI remember going into the home of a young couple, Jeff and Heather, and their little boy, Kai. Jeff grew up an active member of the Church. He was a very talented athlete and had a promising career. He began to drift away from the Church in his teenage years. Later, he got into a car accident, which altered the course of his life. As we entered their home and became acquainted, Jeff asked us why we came to see his family. We responded that there were about 3,000 members who lived within the stake boundaries. I then asked him, Jeff, of all the homes we could have visited tonight, tell us why the Lord has sent us here.\n\nWith that, Jeff became emotional and began to share with us some of his worries and some issues that they were dealing with as a family. We began to share various principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ. We invited them to do a few specific things that might seem to be challenging at first but in time would bring great happiness and joy. Then President Whitworth gave Jeff a priesthood blessing to help him overcome his challenges. Jeff and Heather agreed to do what we invited them to do.\n\nAbout a year later, it was my privilege to watch Jeff baptize his wife, Heather, a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. They are now preparing themselves to enter the temple to be sealed as a family for time and all eternity. Our visit altered the course of their lives both temporally and spiritually.\n\nThe Lord has stated:\n\nWherefore, be faithful; stand in the office which I have appointed unto you; succor the weak, lift up the hands which hang down, and strengthen the feeble knees (Doctrine and Covenants 81:5).\n\nAnd in doing these things thou wilt do the greatest good unto thy fellow beings, and wilt promote the glory of him who is your Lord (Doctrine and Covenants 81:4).\n\nBrothers and sisters, the Apostle Paul taught a key element in our ministering. He taught that we are all the body of Christ, and members in particular (1Corinthians 12:27) and that each member of the body is needed in order to ensure that the entire body is edified. Then he taught a powerful truth that entered deeply into my heart when I read it. He said, Much more those members of the body, which seem to be more feeble, are necessary: and those members of the body, which we think to be less honourable, upon these we bestow more abundant honour (1Corinthians 12:2223; emphasis added).\n\nHence, in each ward and branch we need everyonethose who may be strong and those who are perhaps struggling. All are necessary to the vital edification of the entire body of Christ. I often wonder who we are missing in our various congregations that would strengthen us and make us whole.\n\nElder D.Todd Christofferson taught: In the Church we not only learn divine doctrine; we also experience its application. As the body of Christ, the members of the Church minister to one another in the reality of day-to-day life. All of us are imperfect.  In the body of Christ, we have to go beyond concepts and exalted words and have a real hands-on experience as we learn to live together in love [Doctrine and Covenants 42:45] (Why the Church, Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2015, 1089).\n\nIn 1849, Brigham Young had a dream in which he saw the Prophet Joseph Smith driving a large herd of sheep and goats. Some of these animals were large and beautiful; others were small and dirty. Brigham Young recalled looking into the Prophet Joseph Smiths eyes and saying, Joseph, you have got the darndest flock  I ever saw in my life; what are you going to do with them? The Prophet, who seemed unconcerned with this unruly flock, simply replied, [Brigham,] they are all good in their places.\n\nWhen President Young awoke, he understood that while the Church would gather a variety of sheep and goats, it was his responsibility to bring all in and allow each of them to realize their full potential as they took their places in the Church. (Adapted from RonaldW. Walker, Brigham Young: Student of the Prophet, Ensign, Feb. 1998, 5657.)\n\nBrothers and sisters, the genesis of my talk came about as I thought deeply about one who is not currently engaged in the Church of Jesus Christ. For a moment I would like to speak to each one of them. Elder NealA. Maxwell has taught that such individuals often stay proximate tobut do not participate fully inthe Church. They will not come inside the chapel, but neither do they leave its porch. These are they who need and are needed by the Church, but who, in part, live without God in the world [Mosiah 27:31] (Why Not Now?, Ensign, Nov. 1974,12).\n\nI would echo the invitation of our beloved President RussellM. Nelson as he first spoke to the membership of the Church. He said: Now, to each member of the Church I say, keep on the covenant path. Your commitment to follow the Savior by making covenants with Him and then keeping those covenants will open the door to every spiritual blessing and privilege available to men, women, and children everywhere.\n\nHe then pleaded: Now, if you have stepped off the path, may I invite you with all the hope in my heart to please come back. Whatever your concerns, whatever your challenges, there is a place for you in this, the Lords Church. You and generations yet unborn will be blessed by your actions now to return to the covenant path (As We Go Forward Together, Ensign or Liahona, Apr. 2018,7; emphasis added).\n\nI bear witness of Him, even Jesus Christ, the Master Minister and Savior of us all. I invite each of us to seek out the pobrecitos, the poor little ones among us who are in need. This is my hope and prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, amen."

          "text": "Have you ever held a newborn in your arms? There is a light that emanates from every newborn, bringing a special bond of love that can fill their parents hearts with joy. A Mexican writer wrote, I have learned that when a newborn first squeezes his fathers finger in his tiny fist, he has caught him forever.\n\nParenting is one of lifes most extraordinary experiences. Parents enter a partnership with their Heavenly Father to guide their precious children back to heaven. Today I would like to share some parenting lessons found in the scriptures and taught by living prophets to help us leave our parental legacy.\n\nWe must climb to the higher ground of gospel culture with our families. President RussellM. Nelson declared: Families deserve guidance from heaven. Parents cannot counsel children adequately from personal experience, fear, or sympathy.\n\nAlthough our cultural backgrounds, parenting styles, and personal experiences may be valuable for parenting, these abilities are insufficient to help our children return to heaven. We need access to a more elevated set of values and  practices, a culture of both love and expectations, where we interact with our children in a higher, holier way. President DallinH. Oaks described gospel culture as a distinctive way of life, a set of values and expectations and practices.  This gospel culture comes from the plan of salvation, the commandments of God, and the teachings of  living prophets. It guides us in the way we raise our families and live our individual lives.\n\nJesus Christ is the center of this gospel culture. Adopting the gospel culture in our families is critical to creating a fertile environment where the seed of faith may flourish. To climb to higher ground, President Oaks invited us to give up any personal or family traditions or practices that are contrary to the teachings of the Church of Jesus Christ. Parents, timidity on our part to establish gospel culture may allow the adversary to establish a foothold in our homes or, even worse, in the hearts of our children.\n\nAs we choose to make the gospel culture the predominant culture in our family, then by the powerful influence of the Holy Ghost, our current parenting styles, traditions, and practices will be sifted, aligned, refined, and enhanced.\n\nPresident RussellM. Nelson has taught that the home should be the center of gospel learning. The purpose of gospel learning is to deepen our conversion to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ and help us become more like Them. Lets consider three crucial parenting responsibilities described by prophets and apostles that can help us establish a higher gospel culture in our homes.\n\nHeavenly Father instructed Adam concerning Jesus Christ and His doctrine. He taught him to teach these things freely unto [his] children. In other words, Heavenly Father taught Adam to teach these things liberally, generously, and without restraint. The scriptures tell us that Adam and Eve blessed the name of God, and they made all things known unto their sons and their daughters.\n\nWe teach our children generously when we spend meaningful time with them. We teach without restraint when discussing sensitive topics such as screen time, using resources that the Church has made available. We teach liberally when we study the scriptures with our children using Come, Follow Me and allow the Spirit to be the teacher.\n\nIn the book of John, we read that when several Jews questioned the Savior about His conduct, Jesus directed attention to His model, His Father. He taught, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do: for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise. Parents, what do we need to model for our children? Discipleship.\n\nAs parents, we can teach the importance of putting God first when we discuss the first commandment, but we model it when we set aside worldly distractions and keep the Sabbath day holy every week. We can teach the importance of temple covenants when we speak about the doctrine of celestial marriage, but we model it when we honor our covenants, treating our spouse with dignity.\n\nFaith in Jesus Christ should be the core of our childrens testimonies, and these testimonies must come to each child through individual revelation. To assist our children with the building of their testimonies, we encourage them to use their agency to choose what is right and prepare them for a lifetime on Gods covenant path.\n\nIt would be wise to encourage each of our children to accept President Nelsons invitation to take charge of his or her own testimony of Jesus Christ and His gospelto work for it, to nurture it so that it will grow, to feed it truth, and to not pollute it with false philosophies of unbelieving men and women.\n\nOur Heavenly Fathers divine intentions as a parent were made known in a revelation given to Moses: For behold, this is my work and my gloryto bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man. President Nelson has added, God will do everything He can, short of violating your agency, to help you not miss out on the greatest blessings in all eternity.\n\nAs parents, we are Gods agents in the care of our children. We must do everything we can to create an environment where our children can feel His divine influence.\n\nHeavenly Father never intended for us as parents to sit on the sidelines as spectators, watching the spiritual lives of our children unfold. Let me illustrate this idea of intentional parenting with a personal experience. When I was attending Primary in a small branch in Guatemala, my parents began to teach me about the value of patriarchal blessings. My mother took the time to share her experience of receiving her treasured patriarchal blessing. She taught me the doctrine related to patriarchal blessings, and she testified of promised blessings. Her intentional parenting inspired me to have the desire to receive my patriarchal blessing.\n\nWhen I was 12, my parents helped me navigate the search for a patriarch. This was necessary because there was no patriarch in the district where we lived. I traveled to a patriarch that was in a stake 156 kilometers (97 miles) away. I distinctly remember when the patriarch laid his hands upon my head to bless me. I knew by powerful spiritual confirmation, without a doubt, that my Heavenly Father knew me.\n\nFor a 12-year-old boy from a small town, that meant everything to me. My heart turned to my Heavenly Father that day because of my mother and fathers intentional parenting, and I will be forever grateful to them.\n\nSister JoyD. Jones, former Primary General President, taught: We cannot wait for conversion to simply happen to our children. Accidental conversion is not a principle of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Our love and inspired invitations can make a difference in how our children use their agency. President Nelson emphasized, No other work transcends that of righteous, intentional parenting!\n\nParents, this world is full of philosophies, cultures, and ideas competing for our childrens attention. The great and spacious building advertises its membership daily using the most current media channels. But in the gift of his Son, the prophet Moroni taught, hath God prepared a more excellent way.\n\nAs we partner with God through covenants and become His agents in the care of our children, He will sanctify our intentions, inspire our teachings, and temper our invitations so our children may know to what source they may look for a remission of their sins. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen."

Essential to our doctrine on the family is the temple. The ordinances received there enable us to return as eternal families to the presence of our Heavenly Father.\n\nAs of the April 2025 general conference, President RussellM. Nelson had announced the construction of 200 new temples. He loved to announce new temples at the conclusion of each general conference, and we all rejoiced with him. However, with the large number of temples now in the very earliest phases of planning and construction, it is appropriate that we slow down the announcement of new temples. Therefore, with the approval of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, we will not announce any new temples at this conference. We will now move forward in providing the ordinances of the temple to members of the Church throughout the world, including when and where to announce the construction of new temples.\n\nThe portion of my talk that I have just delivered was written after the death of our beloved President RussellM. Nelson. What now follows was written and approved weeks before, but it still represents my teachings, inspired by the Lord.\n\nThe family proclamation, announced 30 years ago, declares that the family is ordained of God and is central to the Creators plan for the eternal destiny of His children. It also declares that Gods commandment for His children to multiply and replenish the earth remains in force. And we further declare that God has commanded that the sacred powers of procreation are to be employed only between man and woman, lawfully wedded as husband and wife. As then-Elder RussellM. Nelson taught a Brigham Young University audience, the family is pivotal to Gods plan.  In fact, a purpose of the plan is to exalt the family.\n\nThe Church of Jesus Christ is sometimes known as a family-centered church. It is! Our relationship to God and the purpose of our mortal life are explained in terms of the family. The gospel of Jesus Christ is the plan of our Heavenly Father for the benefit of His spirit children. We can truly say that the gospel plan was first taught to us in the council of an eternal family, it is implemented through our mortal families, and its intended destiny is to exalt the children of God in eternal families.\n\nDespite that doctrinal context, there is opposition. In the United States we are suffering from a deterioration in marriage and childbearing. For nearly a hundred years the proportion of households headed by married couples has declined, and so has the birthrate. The marriages and birthrates of our Church members are much more positive, but they have also declined significantly. It is vital that Latter-day Saints do not lose their understanding of the purpose of marriage and the value of children. That is the future for which we strive. Exaltation is a family affair, President Nelson has taught us. Only through the saving ordinances of the gospel of Jesus Christ can families be exalted.\n\nThe national declines in marriage and childbearing are understandable for historic reasons, but Latter-day Saint values and practices should improvenot followthose trends.\n\nIn my boyhood 80 years ago, I lived on my grandparents farm in a setting where almost all that happened during the day was under the direction of the family. There was no television or other electronics to distract from family activities. In contrast, in todays urban society, few members experience consistent family-centered activities. Urban living and modern transportation, organized entertainment, and high-speed communication have made it easy for youth to treat their homes as boardinghouses, where they sleep and take an occasional meal but where there is far less parental direction of their activities.\n\nParental influences have also been diluted by the way in which most current members of the Church earn a living. In times past, one of the great influences that unified families was the experience of struggling together in pursuit of a common goalsuch as taming the wilderness or earning a living. The family was an organized and conducted unit of economic production. Today, most families are units of economic consumption, which do not require a high degree of family organization and cooperation.\n\nAs parental influences diminish, Latter-day Saints still have a God-given responsibility to teach their children to prepare for our family destiny in eternity (see Doctrine and Covenants 68:25). Many of us must do this when not all of our families are traditional. Divorce, death, and separation are realities. I experienced that in the family in which I was raised.\n\nMy father died when I was seven years old, so my younger brother and sister and I were raised by a widowed mother. In the most difficult of situations, she pressed on. She was alone and broken, but with the Lords help, her powerful teaching of the doctrine of the restored Church guided us. How she prayed for heavenly assistance in raising her children, and she was blessed! We were raised in a happy home in which our deceased father was always a reality. She taught us that we had a father and she had a husband and we would always be a family because of their temple marriage. Our father was just away temporarily because the Lord had called him to a different work.\n\nI know that many other families are not so happy, but every single mother can teach of the love of a Heavenly Father and the eventual blessings of a temple marriage. You too can do this! Heavenly Fathers plan assures this possibility for everyone. We are all grateful for temple marriage and for the prospective blessings of being sealed as an eternal family. Like my mother, we love to quote Lehis promise to his son Jacob that God shall consecrate thine afflictions for thy gain (2Nephi 2:2). That applies to every Latter-day Saint family, complete or currently incomplete. We are a family church.\n\nOur doctrine and our belief in eternal families strengthen and bond us. I will never forget the promise of my maternal Grandfather Harris, when we children were living on his farm near Payson, Utah. He gave me the tragic news that my father had died in faraway Denver, Colorado. I ran into the bedroom and knelt beside the bed, crying my heart out. Grandpa followed me and went to his knees beside me and said, I will be your father. That tender promise is a powerful example of what grandparents can do to fill in the gaps when families lose or are missing a member.\n\nParents, single or marriedand others, like grandparents, who fill that role for childrenare the master teachers. Their most effective teaching is by example. The family circle is the ideal place to demonstrate and learn eternal values, such as the importance of marriage and children, the purpose of life, and the true source of joy. It is also the best place to learn other essential lessons of life, such as kindness, forgiveness, self-control, and the value of education and honest work.\n\nOf course, many Church members have beloved family members who do not embrace gospel values and expectations. Such members need our love and patience. In relating to one another, we should remember that the perfection we seek is not limited to the stressful circumstances of mortality. The great teaching in Doctrine and Covenants 138:5759 assures us that repentance and spiritual growth can continue in the spirit world that follows mortality. More important, as families unite to strengthen one another, we should all remember that the sins and inevitable shortcomings all of us experience in mortality can be forgiven through repentance because of the glorious and saving Atonement of Jesus Christ.\n\nOur Savior, Jesus Christ, is our ultimate role model. We will be blessed if we model our lives after His teachings and self-sacrifice. Following Christ and giving ourselves in service to one another is the best remedy for the selfishness and individualism that now seem to be so common.\n\nParents also have a duty to teach their children practical knowledge apart from gospel principles. Families unite when they do meaningful things together. Family gardens build family relationships. Happy family experiences strengthen family ties. Camping, sports activities, and other recreation are especially valuable to bond families. Families should organize family reunions to remember ancestors, which lead to the temple.\n\nParents should educate children in the basic skills of living, including working in the yard and home. Learning languages is a useful preparation for missionary service and modern life. The teachers of these subjects can be parents or grandparents or members of the extended family. Families flourish when they learn as a group and counsel together on all matters of concern to the family and its members.\n\nSome may say, But we have no time for any of that. To find time to do what is truly worthwhile, many parents will find that they can turn their family on if they all turn their technologies off. And parents, remember, what those children really want for dinner is time with you.\n\nGreat blessings come to families if they pray together, kneeling night and morning to offer thanks for blessings and to pray over common concerns. Families are also blessed as they worship together in Church services and in other devotional settings. Family bonds are also strengthened by family stories, creating family traditions, and sharing sacred experiences. President SpencerW. Kimball reminded us that stories of inspiration from our own lives and those of our forebears  are powerful teaching tools. They are often the best sources of inspiration for us and our posterity.\n\nI testify of the Lord Jesus Christ, who is the Only Begotten Son of God, our Eternal Father. He invites us to follow the covenant path that leads to a heavenly family reunion. The sealing powers of the priesthood, directed by the keys restored in the Kirtland Temple, bring families together for eternity (see Doctrine and Covenants 110:1316). They are currently being exercised in a growing number of temples of the Lord throughout the world. This is real. Let us be part of it, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen."

          "text": "Friends, brothers and sisters, we each have a story. As we discover our story, we connect, we belong, we become.\n\nMy name is Gerrit Walter Gong. Gerrit is a Dutch name, Walter (my fathers name) is an American name, and Gong of course is a Chinese name.\n\nExperts estimate some 70110 billion people have lived on the earth. Perhaps only one has been named Gerrit Walter Gong.\n\nWe each have a story. I love the rain on my face [and] the wind as it rushes by. I wobble-waddle with penguins in Antarctica. I give orphans in Guatemala, street kids in Cambodia, Maasai women in the African Mara their first very own photo of themselves.\n\nI wait at the hospital as each of our children is bornonce the doctor has me help.\n\nI trust God. I believe [we] are, that [we] might have joy, that there are times and seasons to everything under heaven.\n\nDo you know your story? What your name means? World population grew from 1.1 billion people in 1820 to nearly 7.8 billion in 2020. The year 1820 seems to be an inflection point in history. Many born after 1820 have living memory and records to identify several family generations. Can you think of a special, sweet memory with a grandparent or other family member?\n\nWhatever the total number of individuals who have lived on the earth, it is finite, countable, one person at a time. You and I, we each matter.\n\nAnd please consider this: whether or not we know them, we are each born of a mother and father. And each mother and father is born of a mother and father. By birth or adoptive lineage, we are ultimately all connected in the family of God and in the human family.\n\nBorn AD 837, my 30th great-grandfather, First Dragon Gong, started our family village in southern China. The first time I visited Gong village, the people said, Wenhan huilaile (Gerrit has returned).\n\nOn my mothers side, our living family tree includes thousands of family names, with more to discover. We each have more family with whom to connect. If you think your great-aunt has completed all your family genealogy, please find your cousins and cousins cousins. Connect your living memory family names with the 10 billion searchable names FamilySearch now has in its online collection and the 1.3 billion individuals in its Family Tree.\n\nAsk friends or family to draw a living tree. As President RussellM. Nelson teaches, living trees have roots and branches. Whether you are your first or tenth known generation, connect yesterday for tomorrow. Connect the roots and branches in your living family tree.\n\nThe question Where are you from? asks lineage, birthplace, and home country or homeland. Globally, 25 percent of us trace our homeland to China, 23 percent to India, 17 percent to other parts of Asia and the Pacific, 18 percent to Europe, 10 percent to Africa, 7 percent to the Americas.\n\nThe question Where are you from? also invites us to discover our divine identity and spiritual purpose in life.\n\nWe each have a story.\n\nA family I know connected five family generations when they visited their old home in Winnipeg, Canada. There the grandfather told his grandsons about the day two missionaries (he called them angels from heaven) brought the restored gospel of Jesus Christ, changing their family forever.\n\nA mother I know invited her children and their cousins to ask their great-grandmother about her childhood experiences. Great-Grandmas adventures and life lessons are now a treasured family book uniting generations.\n\nA young man I know is compiling a Dad journal. Years ago, a car hit and killed his father. Now, to know his father, this courageous young man is preserving childhood memories and stories from family and friends.\n\nWhen asked where meaning comes in life, most people rank family first. This includes family living and gone before. Of course, when we die, we dont cease to exist. We continue to live on the other side of the veil.\n\nStill very much alive, our ancestors deserve to be remembered. We remember our heritage through oral histories, clan records and family stories, memorials or places of remembrance, and celebrations with photos, foods, or items which remind us of loved ones.\n\nThink of where you liveisnt it wonderful how your country and community remember and honor ancestors, family, others who served and sacrificed? For example, at the autumn harvest remembrance in South Molton, Devonshire, England, Sister Gong and I loved finding the little church and community where generations of our Bawden family lived. We honor our ancestors by opening the heavens through temple and family history work and by becoming a welding link in the chain of our generations.\n\nIn this age of I choose me, societies benefit when generations connect in meaningful ways. We need roots to have wingsreal relationships, meaningful service, life beyond fleeting social media veneers.\n\nConnecting with our ancestors can change our lives in surprising ways. From their trials and accomplishments, we gain faith and strength. From their love and sacrifices, we learn to forgive and move forward. Our children become resilient. We gain protection and power. Ties with ancestors increase family closeness, gratitude, miracles. Such ties can bring help from the other side of the veil.\n\nJust as joys come in families, so can sorrows. No individual is perfect, nor is any family. When those who should love, nurture, and protect us fail to do so, we feel abandoned, embarrassed, hurt. Family can become a hollow shell. Yet, with heavens help, we can come to understand our family and make peace with each other.\n\nSometimes unwavering commitment to abiding family relationships helps us accomplish hard things. In some cases, community becomes family. A remarkable young woman whose troubled family moved frequently found a loving Church family wherever she was to nurture and give her place. Genetics and family patterns influence but do not determine us.\n\nGod wants our families to be happy and forever. Forever is too long if we make each other unhappy. Happy is too short if cherished relationships stop with this life. Through sacred covenants, Jesus Christ offers His love, power, and grace to change us and heal our relationships. Selfless temple service for dear ones makes our Saviors Atonement real for them and us. Sanctified, we can return home to Gods presence as families united eternally.\n\nEach of our stories is a journey still in progress, as we discover, create, and become with possibilities beyond imagination.\n\nThe Prophet Joseph Smith said, It may seem to some to be a very bold doctrine that we talk ofa power which records or binds on earth and binds in heaven. The sociality we create here can exist with eternal glory there. Indeed, we without [our family members] cannot be made perfect; neither can they without us be made perfect, that is, in a whole and complete and perfect union.\n\nWhat can we do now?\n\nFirst, imagine your image reflected back and forth between two mirrors of eternity. In one direction, picture yourself as daughter, granddaughter, great-granddaughter; in the other direction, smile at yourself as aunt, mother, grandmother. How quickly time passes! In each time and role, notice who is with you. Gather their photos and stories; make their memories real. Record their names, experiences, key dates. They are your familythe family you have and the family you want.\n\nAs you perform temple ordinances for family members, the spirit of Elijah, a manifestation of the Holy Ghost bearing witness of the divine nature of the family, will knit the hearts of your fathers, mothers, and children together in love.\n\nSecond, let the adventure of family history be intentional and spontaneous. Call your grandmother. Look deeply into the eyes of that new baby. Make timediscover eternityat each stage of your journey. Learn and acknowledge with gratitude and honesty your family heritage. Celebrate and become the positive and, where needed, humbly do everything possible not to pass on the negative. Let good things begin with you.\n\nThird, visit FamilySearch.org. Download the available mobile apps. Theyre free and fun. Discover, connect, belong. See how you are related to people in a room, how easy and rewarding it is to add names to your living family tree, to find and bless your roots and branches.\n\nFourth, help unite families eternally. Remember the demographics of heaven. There are many more on the other side of the veil than on this side. As more temples come closer to us, please offer those waiting for temple ordinances opportunity to receive them.\n\nThe promise at Easter and always is that, in and through Jesus Christ, we can become our best story and our families can become happy and forever. In all our generations, Jesus Christ heals the brokenhearted, delivers the captives, sets at liberty them that are bruised. Covenant belonging with God and each other includes knowing our spirit and body will be reunited in resurrection and our most precious relationships can continue beyond death with a fulness of joy.\n\nWe each have a story. Come discover yours. Come find your voice, your song, your harmony in Him. This is the very purpose for which God created the heavens and the earth and saw that they were good.\n\nPraise Gods plan of happiness, Jesus Christs Atonement, continuing restoration in His gospel and Church. Please come find your family, all your generations, and bring them home. In the sacred and holy name of Jesus Christ, amen."

          "text": "My dear brothers and sisters, I am grateful to have been invited to speak to you in this 189th Annual General Conference of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. On this date in 1830, Joseph Smith organized the Church under the direction of the Lord. It was done in the Whitmer family home near Fayette, New York. There were six members and about 50 other interested people there that day.\n\nAlthough I dont know what the Prophet Joseph said or how he looked when he stood before that little group, I know what those people with faith in Jesus Christ felt. They felt the Holy Ghost, and they felt that they were in a holy place. They surely felt that they were united as one.\n\nThat miraculous feeling is what we all want in our homes. It is a feeling that comes from being, as Paul described, spiritually minded.\n\nMy purpose today is to teach what I know of how we can qualify for that feeling more often and invite it to last longer in our families. As you know from experience, that is not easy to do. Contention, pride, and sin have to be kept at bay. The pure love of Christ must come into the hearts of those in our family.\n\nAdam and Eve, Lehi and Sariah, and other parents we know from scripture found that to be a hard challenge. Yet there are encouraging examples of sustained felicity in families and homes to reassure us. And those examples let us see the way it can happen for us and our families. You remember the account from 4Nephi:\n\nAnd it came to pass that there was no contention in the land, because of the love of God which did dwell in the hearts of the people.\n\nAnd there were no envyings, nor strifes, nor tumults, nor whoredoms, nor lyings, nor murders, nor any manner of lasciviousness; and surely there could not be a happier people among all the people who had been created by the hand of God.\n\nThere were no robbers, nor murderers, neither were there Lamanites, nor any manner of -ites; but they were in one, the children of Christ, and heirs to the kingdom of God.\n\nAnd how blessed were they! For the Lord did bless them in all their doings; yea, even they were blessed and prospered until an hundred and ten years had passed away; and the first generation from Christ had passed away, and there was no contention in all the land.\n\nAs you know, that happy time did not endure forever. The account in 4Nephi describes the eventual symptoms of spiritual decline among a group of good people. It is a pattern that has appeared over the ages in entire peoples, in congregations, and, most sadly, in families. By studying that pattern, we can see how we might protect and even increase the feelings of love in our family.\n\nHere is the pattern of decline that appeared after 200 years of living in the perfect peace the gospel brings:\n\nPride crept in.\n\nThe people stopped sharing what they had with each other.\n\nThey began to see themselves in classes above or below each other.\n\nThey began to diminish in their faith in Jesus Christ.\n\nThey began to hate.\n\nThey began to commit all kinds of sin.\n\nWise parents will be alert enough to notice those symptoms when they appear among their family members. They will, of course, be concerned. But they will know that the underlying cause is the influence of Satan trying to lead good people down a path to sin and thus to lose the influence of the Holy Ghost. So the wise parent will see that opportunity lies in leading each child, and themselves, to accept more fully the Lords invitation to come unto Him.\n\nYou could have limited success by calling a child to repent, for instance, of pride. You might try persuading children to share what they have more generously. You could ask them to stop feeling they are better than someone else in the family. But then you come to the symptom I described earlier as They began to diminish in their faith in Jesus Christ.\n\nThere is the key to leading your family to rise to that spiritual place you want for themand for you to be there with them. As you help them grow in faith that Jesus Christ is their loving Redeemer, they will feel a desire to repent. As they do, humility will begin to replace pride. As they begin to feel what the Lord has given them, they will want to share more generously. Rivalry for prominence or recognition will diminish. Hate will be driven out by love. And finally, like it did for the people converted by King Benjamin, the desire to do good will fortify them against temptation to sin. King Benjamins people testified that they had no more disposition to do evil.\n\nSo building faith in Jesus Christ is the beginning of reversing spiritual decline in your family and in your home. That faith is more likely to bring repentance than your preaching against each symptom of spiritual decline.\n\nYou will best lead by example. Family members and others must see you growing in your own faith in Jesus Christ and in His gospel. You have recently been provided great help. Parents in the Church have been blessed with an inspired curriculum for families and individuals. As you use it, you will build your faith and the faith of your children in the Lord Jesus Christ.\n\nYour faith in the Savior has grown as you followed President RussellM. Nelsons suggestion to reread the Book of Mormon. You marked passages and words that referred to the Savior. Your faith in Jesus Christ grew. But like a new plant, such faith in Jesus Christ will wither unless you find continued resolve to ponder and pray to increase it.\n\nYour example of growing in faith may not be followed by all members of your family now. But take heart from the experience of Alma the Younger. In his painful need for repentance and forgiveness, he remembered his fathers faith in Jesus Christ. Your children may remember your faith in the Savior at a moment when they desperately need repentance. Alma said of such a moment:\n\nAnd it came to pass that as I was thus racked with torment, while I was harrowed up by the memory of my many sins, behold, I remembered also to have heard my father prophesy unto the people concerning the coming of one Jesus Christ, a Son of God, to atone for the sins of the world.\n\nNow, as my mind caught hold upon this thought, I cried within my heart: O Jesus, thou Son of God, have mercy on me, who am in the gall of bitterness, and am encircled about by the everlasting chains of death.\n\nAnd now, behold, when I thought this, I could remember my pains no more; yea, I was harrowed up by the memory of my sins no more.\n\nIn addition to your example of growing in faith, your praying as a family can play a crucial part in making home a sacred place. One person is usually chosen as voice to pray for the family. When the prayer is clearly to God in behalf of the people kneeling and listening, faith grows in all of them. They can feel expressions of love for Heavenly Father and for the Savior. And when the person who prays mentions those who are kneeling in that circle who are in need, all can feel love for them and for each member of the family.\n\nEven when family members are not living in the home, prayer can build bonds of love. Prayer in the family can reach across the world. More than once I have learned that a family member far away was praying at the same moment for the same thing as I was. For me, the old saying The family that prays together stays together could be expanded to The family that prays together is together, even when they are far apart.\n\nBecause none of us is perfect and feelings are easily hurt, families can become sacred sanctuaries only as we repent early and sincerely. Parents can set an example. Harsh words or unkind thoughts can be repented of quickly and sincerely. A simple I am sorry can heal wounds and invite both forgiveness and love.\n\nThe Prophet Joseph Smith was a model for us as he dealt with vicious attacks, with traitors, and even with disagreements in his family. He forgave quickly, even though he knew the attacker might attack again. He asked for forgiveness, and he gave it freely.\n\nThe sons of Mosiah were determined to offer the gospel to everyone. This desire came from their personal experience with repentance. They could not bear the thought of any person suffering the effects of sin as they had. So they faced years of rejection, hardship, and danger to offer the gospel of Jesus Christ to their enemies. In the process, they found joy in the many who repented and experienced the joy of forgiveness through the Atonement of Jesus Christ.\n\nOur family members will grow in their desire to share the gospel as they feel the joy of forgiveness. That can come even as they renew covenants when they partake of the sacrament. The missionary spirit will grow in our homes as children and parents feel the joy of forgiveness in the sacrament service. By their example of reverence, both parents and children can help each other feel that joy. That joy can go far in turning our homes into missionary training centers. All might not serve missions, but all will feel the desire to share the gospel, which has brought them to feel forgiveness and peace. And whether currently serving full-time or not, all can feel joy in offering the gospel to others.\n\nFor both parents and children, the temple is the best opportunity to gain a feeling for and a love of heavenly places. That is especially true when the children are young. Children are born with the Light of Christ. Even a baby can feel that a temple is sacred. Because parents love their little children, the temple represents for them the hope that they can have their children to love in their eternal familyforever.\n\nSome of you have photographs of temples in your homes. As temples are being added across the earth, it is possible for many parents to visit temple grounds with their families. A few may even be able to attend open houses when temples are built. Parents can ask children how they felt to be near or in a temple.\n\nEvery parent can bear testimony of what a temple has meant to him or her. President Ezra Taft Benson, who loved temples, spoke often of watching his mother carefully press her temple clothing. He spoke of his memory as a boy watching his family as they left his home to attend the temple.\n\nWhen he was the President of the Church, he attended the temple the same day each week. He always did the temple work for an ancestor. It came largely from the example of his parents.\n\nYou will find some of your greatest joys in your efforts to make your home a place of faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and a place that is permeated with love, the pure love of Christ. The Restoration of the gospel started with a humble question pondered in a humble home, and it can continue in each of our homes as we continue to establish and practice gospel principles there. This has been my hope and my deepest desire since I was a little boy. You have all had glimpses of such homes. Many of you have, with the Lords help, created them.\n\nSome have tried with full heart for that blessing, yet it has not been granted. My promise to you is one that a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles once made to me. I had said to him that because of choices some in our extended family had made, I doubted that we could be together in the world to come. He said, as well as I can remember, You are worrying about the wrong problem. You just live worthy of the celestial kingdom, and the family arrangements will be more wonderful than you can imagine.\n\nI believe that he would extend that happy hope to any of us in mortality who have done all we can to qualify ourselves and our family members for eternal life. I know that Heavenly Fathers plan is a plan of happiness. I testify that His plan makes it possible for each of us who has done the best we can to be sealed in a family forever.\n\nI know that the priesthood keys restored to Joseph Smith were passed on in an unbroken line to President RussellM. Nelson. Those keys make possible the sealing of families today. I know that Heavenly Father loves us, His spirit children, with a perfect love. I know that because of the Atonement of Jesus Christ, we can repent, be cleansed, and become worthy to live in loving families forever with our Heavenly Father and with His Beloved Son, Jesus Christ. I so testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen."

Many of us must do this when not all of our families are traditional. Divorce, death, and separation are realities. I experienced that in the family in which I was raised.', 'The doctrine of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints centers on the family. Essential to our doctrine on the family is the temple. The ordinances received there enable us to return as eternal families to the presence of our Heavenly Father.']"

          "text": "In our family, we sometimes play a game we call The Crazy Trust Exercise. You may have played it too. Two people stand a few feet apart, one with their back toward the other. On a signal from the person behind, the person in front falls backward into the waiting arms of their friend.\n\nTrust is the foundation of all relationships. A threshold question to any relationship is Can I trust the other person? A relationship forms only when people are willing to place trust in each other. It is not a relationship if one person trusts completely but the other does not.\n\nEach of us is a beloved spirit son or daughter of a loving Heavenly Father. But while that spiritual genealogy provides a foundation, it does not of itself create a meaningful relationship with God. A relationship can be built only when we choose to trust in Him.\n\nHeavenly Father desires to build a close, personal relationship with each of His spirit children. Jesus expressed that desire when He prayed, That they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us. The relationship God seeks with each spirit child is one so close and personal that He will be able to share all He has and all He is. That kind of deep, enduring relationship can develop only when built upon perfect, total trust.\n\nFor His part, Heavenly Father has worked from the beginning to communicate His absolute trust in the divine potential of each of His children. Trust underlies the plan He presented for our growth and progression prior to our coming to earth. He would teach us eternal laws, create an earth, provide us with mortal bodies, give us the gift to choose for ourselves, and permit us to learn and grow by making our own choices. He wants us to choose to follow His laws and return to enjoy eternal life with Him and His Son.\n\nKnowing that we would not always make good choices, He also prepared a way for us to escape from the consequences of bad choices. He provided us a SaviorHis Son, Jesus Christto atone for our sins and make us clean again on condition of repentance. He invites us to use the precious gift of repentance regularly.\n\nEvery parent knows how difficult it is to trust a child enough to let them make their own decisions, especially when the parent knows the child is likely to make mistakes and suffer as a result. Yet Heavenly Father allows us to make the choices that will help us reach our divine potential! As Elder DaleG. Renlund taught, [His] goal in parenting is not to have His children do what is right; it is to have His children choose to do what is right and ultimately become like Him.\n\nNotwithstanding Gods trust in us, our relationship with Him will grow only to the degree we are willing to place our trust in Him. The challenge is that we live in a fallen world and have all experienced a betrayal of trust as the result of dishonesty, manipulation, coercion, or other circumstances. Once betrayed, we may struggle to trust again. These negative trust experiences with imperfect mortals may even impact our willingness to trust in a perfect Heavenly Father.\n\nSeveral years ago, two friends of mine, Leonid and Valentina, expressed interest in becoming members of the Church. As Leonid began to learn the gospel, he found it difficult to pray. Earlier in his life, Leonid had suffered from manipulation and control by superiors and had developed a distrust of authority. These experiences affected his ability to open his heart and express personal feelings to Heavenly Father. With time and study, Leonid gained a better understanding of Gods character and experienced feeling Gods love. Eventually, prayer became a natural way for him to express thanks and the love he was feeling for God. His increasing trust in God eventually led him and Valentina to enter into sacred covenants to strengthen their relationship with God and each other.\n\nIf prior loss of trust is keeping you from trusting God, please follow Leonids example. Patiently continue to learn more about Heavenly Father, His character, His attributes, and His purposes. Look for and record experiences feeling His love and power in your life. Our living prophet, President RussellM. Nelson, has taught that the more we learn about God, the easier it will be for us to trust Him.\n\nSometimes the best way to learn to trust God is simply by trusting Him. Like The Crazy Trust Exercise, sometimes we just need to be willing to fall backward and let Him catch us. Our mortal life is a test. Challenges that stretch us beyond our own capacity come frequently. When our own knowledge and understanding are inadequate, we naturally look for resources to help us. In an information-saturated world, there is no shortage of sources promoting their solutions to our challenges. However, the simple, time-tested counsel in Proverbs provides the best advice: Trust in the Lord with all thine heart. We show our trust in God by turning to Him first when confronted with lifes challenges.\n\nAfter I finished law school in Utah, our family faced the important decision of where to work and make our home. After counseling with each other and the Lord, we felt directed to move our family to the eastern United States, far from parents and siblings. Initially, things went well, and we felt confirmed in our decision. But then things changed. There was downsizing at the law firm, and I faced the prospect of no job or insurance at the very time our daughter Dora was born with serious medical challenges and long-term special needs. While confronting these challenges, I was extended a call to serve that would require significant time and commitment.\n\nI had never faced such a challenge and was overwhelmed. I began to question the decision we had made and its accompanying confirmation. We had trusted in the Lord, and things were supposed to work out. I had fallen backward, and it now appeared that no one was going to catch me.\n\nOne day the words Dont ask why; ask what I want you to learn came distinctly into my mind and heart. Now I was even more confused. In the very moment I was struggling with my earlier decision, God was inviting me to trust Him even more. Looking back, this was a critical point in my lifeit was the moment when I realized that the best way to learn to trust in God was simply by trusting Him. In the subsequent weeks, I watched with amazement as the Lord miraculously unfolded His plan to bless our family.\n\nGood teachers and coaches know that intellectual growth and physical strength can happen only when minds and muscles are stretched. Likewise, God invites us to grow by trusting His spiritual tutoring through soul-stretching experiences. Therefore, we can be sure that whatever trust we may have demonstrated in God in the past, another trust-stretching experience lies yet ahead. God is focused on our growth and progress. He is the Master Teacher, the complete coach who is always stretching us to help us realize more of our divine potential. That will always include a future invitation to trust Him just a little bit more.\n\nThe Book of Mormon teaches the pattern God uses to stretch us in order to build strong relationships with us. In Come, Follow Me, we recently studied about how Nephis trust in God was tested when he and his brothers were commanded to return to Jerusalem to obtain the brass plates. After their initial attempts failed, his brothers gave up and were ready to return without the plates. But Nephi chose to place his complete trust in the Lord and was successful in obtaining the plates. That experience likely strengthened Nephis confidence in God when his bow broke and the family was facing starvation in the wilderness. Again, Nephi chose to trust in God, and the family was saved. These successive experiences gave Nephi even stronger confidence in God for the enormous, trust-stretching task he would soon face of building a ship.\n\nThrough these experiences, Nephi strengthened his relationship with God by consistently and continuously trusting Him. God uses the same pattern with us. He extends us personal invitations to strengthen and deepen our trust in Him. Each time we accept and act on an invitation, our trust in God grows. If we ignore or decline an invitation, our progress stops until were ready to act on a new invitation.\n\nThe good news is that regardless of the trust we may or may not have chosen to place in God in the past, we can choose to trust God today and every day going forward. I promise that each time we do, God will be there to catch us, and our relationship of trust will grow stronger and stronger until the day that we become one with Him and His Son. Then we can declare like Nephi, O Lord, I have trusted in thee, and I will trust in thee forever. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen."

          "text": "My dear brothers and sisters, I feel the love of the Lord as we meet together. I am humbled to speak with you. I pray that the Spirit will carry into your hearts what the Lord would have you hear, far beyond the words which I will speak.\n\nLong ago I sought to learn physics and mathematics in my college years. I felt overwhelmed. I began to feel that I was trying to learn something that was beyond me. The more I felt overwhelmed, the less I felt the strength to keep trying. My discouragement led me to feel that my efforts were almost fruitless. I began to think of quitting, of doing something easier.\n\nI felt weak. As I prayed, I felt the quiet assurance of the Lord. I felt Him say to my mind, I am proving you, but I am also with you.\n\nI did not know then all that those words meant. But I knew what to doI went to work.\n\nBy pondering and working during the years that followed, I came to understand this message of encouragement in the scriptures: I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.\n\nI learned that my struggle with physics was actually a gift from the Lord. He was teaching me that with His help, I could do things that seemed impossible if I had the faith that He would be there to help me. Through this gift, the Lord was working to prove and strengthen me.\n\nThe word prove has several meanings. To prove something is not simply to test it. It is to increase its strength. To prove a piece of steel is to place it under strain. Heat, weight, and pressure are added until its true nature is enhanced and revealed. The steel is not weakened by the proving. In fact, it becomes something that can be trusted, something strong enough to bear greater burdens.\n\nThe Lord proves us in much the same way to strengthen us. That proving does not come in moments of ease or comfort. It comes in moments when we feel stretched beyond what we thought we could bear. The Lord teaches that we are to continue to grow and never tire in our efforts, that we never give up, that we keep trying.\n\nWhen we continue to have faith in Jesus Christeven when things might feel impossible to us at the momentwe become spiritually stronger. The sacred scriptural records emphasize this truth.\n\nThe prophet Moroni, for instance, was proved and strengthened in such a way. He lived his final years alone. He wrote that he had no friends, that his father had been killed, that his people had been destroyed. He was hunted by those who sought his life.\n\nYet Moroni did not despair. Instead, he engraved his testimony of Jesus Christ on plates for people he would not live to see, including the descendants of the people who desired to kill him. He wrote for us. He knew that some would mock his words. He knew that some would reject them. Yet he kept writing.\n\nIn his proving, Moronis faith was refined and strengthened. It became more pure. His words carry the power of one who endured faithfully to the end. We can feel that power as we read his testimony:\n\nNow I, Moroni, write somewhat as seemeth me good; and I write unto my brethren, the Lamanites; and I would that they should know that more than four hundred and twenty years have passed away since the sign was given of the coming of Christ.\n\nAnd I seal up these records, after I have spoken a few words by way of exhortation unto you.\n\nBehold, I would exhort you that when ye shall read these things, if it be wisdom in God that ye should read them, that ye would remember how merciful the Lord hath been unto the children of men, from the creation of Adam even down until the time that ye shall receive these things, and ponder it in your hearts.\n\nAnd when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost.\n\nAnd by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things.\n\nMoronis testimony was refined in loneliness, but it shines with light to guide all generations to seek our Father in Heaven and the Savior Jesus Christ.\n\nAnother Book of Mormon prophet, Jacob, was proved and strengthened as a child who experienced afflictions and much sorrow. But his father, Lehi, taught him God would bless him through his trials.\n\nAnd behold, in thy childhood thou hast suffered afflictions and much sorrow, because of the rudeness of thy brethren.\n\nNevertheless, Jacob, my firstborn in the wilderness, thou knowest the greatness of God; and he shall consecrate thine afflictions for thy gain.\n\nWherefore, thy soul shall be blessed, and thou shalt dwell safely with thy brother, Nephi; and thy days shall be spent in the service of thy God. Wherefore, I know that thou art redeemed, because of the righteousness of thy Redeemer; for thou hast beheld that in the fulness of time he cometh to bring salvation unto men.\n\nThe Prophet Joseph Smith experienced such proving and strengthening when he was in Liberty Jail. In the depths of his anguish, the Prophet Joseph cried out:\n\nO God, where art thou?\n\nHow long shall thy hand be stayed?\n\nThe Lord saw in Josephs suffering the sanctifying effect of his enduring it well when He replied:\n\nMy son, peace be unto thy soul; thine adversity and thine afflictions shall be but a small moment;\n\nAnd then, if thou endure it well, God shall exalt thee on high; thou shalt triumph over all thy foes.\n\nThe greatest example of proving and strengthening occurred through the Saviors Atonement. He took upon Him the sins of the world. He bore our pains and our sorrows. He drank the bitter cup. He proved faithful in every moment.\n\nBecause of His glorious Atonement, Jesus Christ can strengthen us in our times of trial. He knows how to succor us because He has felt all the challenges that we will ever feel in mortality. He will take upon him the pains and the sicknesses of his people  that he may know according to the flesh how to succor his people according to their infirmities.\n\nWe learn that while in the Garden of Gethsemane, the Savior did ask the Father if the trial could pass over Himbut then He also said that if it was the Fathers will, then the Savior would do it. In other words, the Savior even took on doubt and uncertainty, but He had faith in His Heavenly Father.\n\nBrothers and sisters, your proving and strengthening may not look like Moronis or Jacobs or the Prophet Josephs. But it will come. It may come quietly, through the trials of family life. It may come through illness or disappointment or grief or loneliness.\n\nI bear witness that these moments are not evidence that the Lord has abandoned you. Rather, they are evidence that He loves you enough to refine and strengthen you. He is making you strong enough to carry the weight of eternal life.\n\nIf we remain faithful in our service, the Lord will refine us. He will strengthen us. And one day we will look back and see that those very trials were evidence of His love. We will see that He was shaping us to be able to stand with Him in glory. As the Lords Apostle Paul stated at the end of his own life, I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith.\n\nI testify that God knows you. He knows the trials you face. He is with you. He will not forsake you. I testify that Jesus Christ is the Son of God. He is our strength, our Redeemer, our hope. If we trust Him, He will make our spiritual power equal to every trial we are called to bear. I so testify in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen."

          "text": "Dear brothers and sisters, the story is told of a Primary child learning to pray. Thank you for the letter A, the letter B,  the letter G. The childs prayer continues, Thank you for the letters X, Y, Z. Dear Heavenly Father, thank you for the number 1, the number 2. The Primary teacher worries but wisely waits. The child says, Thank you for the number 5, the number 6and thank you for my Primary teacher. Shes the only person whos ever let me finish my prayer.\n\nHeavenly Father does hear every childs prayer. With infinite love, He beckons us to come believe and belong by covenant.\n\nThis world is full of mirage, illusion, sleight of hand. So much seems transitory and superficial. When we put aside the masks, pretense, crowd-sourced likes and dislikes, we yearn for more than fleeting veneer, ephemeral connection, or the pursuit of worldly self-interest. Gratefully, there is a way through to answers that matter.\n\nWhen we come to Gods great commandments to love Him and those around us by covenant, we do so not as stranger or guest but as His child at home. The age-old paradox is still true. In losing our worldly self through covenant belonging, we find and become our best eternal selffree, alive, realand define our most important relationships. Covenant belonging is to make and keep solemn promises to God and each other through sacred ordinances that invite the power of godliness to be manifest in our lives. When we covenant all we are, we can become more than we are. Covenant belonging gives us place, narrative, capacity to become. It produces faith unto life and salvation.\n\nDivine covenants become a source of love for and from God and thereby for and with each other. God, our Heavenly Father, loves us more and knows us better than we love or know ourselves. Faith in Jesus Christ and personal change (repentance) bring mercy, grace, forgiveness. These comfort the hurt, loneliness, injustice we experience in mortality. Being God, our Heavenly Father wants us to receive Gods greatest giftHis joy, His eternal life.\n\nOur God is a God of covenant. By His nature, He keepest covenant and showest mercy. His covenants endure so long as time shall last, or the earth shall stand, or there shall be one man upon the face thereof to be saved. We are not meant to wander in existential uncertainty and doubt but to rejoice in cherished covenant relationships stronger than the cords of death.\n\nGods ordinances and covenants are universal in their requirement and individual in their opportunity. In Gods fairness, each individual in every place and age can receive saving ordinances. Agency appliesindividuals choose whether to accept offered ordinances. Gods ordinances provide guideposts on His path of covenants. We call Gods plan to bring His children home the plan of redemption, plan of salvation, plan of happiness. Redemption, salvation, celestial happiness are possible because Jesus Christ wrought out this perfect atonement.\n\nTo belong with God and to walk with each other on His covenant path is to be blessed by covenant belonging.\n\nFirst, covenant belonging centers in Jesus Christ as mediator of the new covenant. All things can work together for our good when we are sanctified in Christ  in the covenant of the Father. Every good and promised blessing comes to those who remain faithful to the end. The happy state of those that keep the commandments of God is to be blessed in all things, both temporal and spiritual, and to dwell with God in  never-ending happiness.\n\nAs we honor our covenants, we may sometimes feel we are in the company of angels. And we will bethose we love and who bless us on this side of the veil and those who love and bless us from the other side of the veil.\n\nRecently Sister Gong and I saw covenant belonging at its tender best in a hospital room. A young father desperately needed a kidney transplant. His family had wept, fasted, and prayed for him to receive a kidney. When news came that a life-saving kidney had just become available, his wife quietly said, I hope the other family is OK. To belong by covenant is, in the words of the Apostle Paul, that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me.\n\nAlong lifes path, we may lose faith in God, but He never loses faith in us. As it were, His porch light is always on. He invites us to come or return to the covenants that mark His path. He waits ready to embrace us, even when we are yet a great way off. When we look with an eye of faith for the patterns, arc, or connected dots of our experience, we can see His tender mercies and encouragement, especially in our trials, sorrows, and challenges, as well as in our joys. However often we stumble or fall, if we keep moving toward Him, He will help us, a step at a time.\n\nSecond, the Book of Mormon is evidence we can hold in our hand of covenant belonging. The Book of Mormon is the promised instrument for the gathering of Gods children, prophesied as a new covenant. As we read the Book of Mormon, by ourselves and with others, whether silently or aloud, we can ask God with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, and receive by the power of the Holy Ghost Gods assurance that the Book of Mormon is true. This includes assurance that Jesus Christ is our Savior, Joseph Smith is the prophet of the Restoration, and the Lords Church is called by His nameThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\n\nThe Book of Mormon speaks by ancient and modern covenant to you who are the children of Lehi, children of the prophets. Your forefathers received a covenant promise that you, their descendants, would recognize a voice as if from the dust in the Book of Mormon. That voice you feel as you read testifies you are children of the covenant and Jesus is your Good Shepherd.\n\nThe Book of Mormon invites each of us, in Almas words, to enter into a covenant with [the Lord], that [we] will serve him and keep his commandments, that he may pour out his Spirit more abundantly upon [us]. When we want to change for the betteras one person put it, to stop being miserable and to be happy being happywe can become open to direction, help, and strength. We can come by covenant to belong with God and a community of faithful believers and receive the blessings promised in the doctrine of Christnow.\n\nRestored priesthood authority and power to bless all His children is a third dimension of covenant belonging. In this dispensation, John the Baptist and the Apostles Peter, James, and John have come as glorified messengers from God to restore His priesthood authority. Gods priesthood and His ordinances sweeten relationships on earth and can seal covenant relationships in heaven.\n\nPriesthood can bless literally from cradle to gravefrom an infants name and blessing to a grave dedication. Priesthood blessings heal, comfort, counsel. A father was angry with his son until forgiving love came as the father gave his son a tender priesthood blessing. The only member of the Church in her family, a dear young woman was uncertain about Gods love for her until she received an inspired priesthood blessing. Across the world, noble patriarchs prepare spiritually to give patriarchal blessings. As the patriarch lays his hands on your head, he feels and expresses Gods love for you. He pronounces your lineage in the house of Israel. He indicates blessings from the Lord. Typically thoughtful, one patriarchs wife told me how she and her family invite the Spirit, especially on days their papa is giving patriarchal blessings.\n\nFinally, the blessings of covenant belonging come when we follow the Lords prophet and rejoice in temple-covenant living, including in marriage. Covenant marriage becomes supernal and eternal as we daily choose the happiness of our spouse and family before our own. As me becomes we, we grow together. We grow old together; we grow young together. As we bless each other across a lifetime of forgetting ourselves, we find our hopes and joys sanctified in time and eternity.\n\nWhile situations differ, when we do all we can, the best we can, and sincerely ask and seek His help along the way, the Lord will guide us, in His time and manner, by the Holy Ghost. Marriage covenants are binding by mutual choice of those making thema reminder of Gods and our respect for agency and the blessing of His help when we unitedly seek it.\n\nThe fruits of covenant belonging across family generations are felt in our homes and hearts. Please allow me to illustrate with personal examples.\n\nWhen Sister Gong and I were falling in love toward marriage, I learned about agency and decisions. For a period of time, we were in school studying in two different countries on two different continents. It is why I can honestly say I earned a PhD in international relations.\n\nWhen I asked, Heavenly Father, should I marry Susan? I felt peace. But it was when I learned to pray with real intent, Heavenly Father, I love Susan and want to marry her. I promise I will be the best husband and father I can bewhen I acted and made my best decisions, it was then the strongest spiritual confirmations came.\n\nNow our Gong and Lindsay FamilySearch family trees, stories, and photos help us discover and connect through the lived experience of generational covenant belonging. For us, respected progenitors include:\n\nGreat-Grandma Alice Blauer Bangerter, who had three marriage proposals in one day, later asked her husband to rig a foot pedal to her butter churn so she could churn butter, knit, and read at the same time.\n\nGreat-Grandpa Loy Kuei Char carried his children on his back and his familys few belongings on a donkey as they crossed the lava fields on Hawaiis Big Island. Generations of Char family commitment and sacrifice bless our family today.\n\nGram Mary Alice Powell Lindsay was left with five young children when her husband and oldest son both died suddenly just days apart. A widow for 47 years, Gram raised her family with sustaining love from local leaders and members. During those many years, Gram promised the Lord if He would help her, she would never complain. The Lord helped her. She never complained.\n\nDear brothers and sisters, as witnessed by the Holy Ghost, everything good and eternal is centered in the living reality of God, our Eternal Father, and His Son, Jesus Christ, and His Atonement. Our Lord, Jesus Christ, is the Mediator of the new covenant. Testifying of Jesus Christ is a covenant purpose of the Book of Mormon. By oath and covenant, Gods restored priesthood authority is intended to bless all Gods children, including through covenant marriage, generational family, and individual blessings.\n\nOur Savior declares, I am Alpha and Omega, Christ the Lord; yea, even I am he, the beginning and the end, the Redeemer of the world.\n\nWith us at the beginning, He is with us, in all our covenant belonging, to the end. I so testify in the sacred and holy name of Jesus Christ, amen."

          "text": "When I was 17, I made an agreement with my friend Jos Luis to teach him how to swim. So one morning we dedicated time to practice. When our lesson was over and I was leaving the pool, I heard my friend shouting for help. He was drowning in the deep end of the pool.\n\nI threw myself into the water and swam toward him while praying for help. As I grabbed his hand to pull him to the surface, my desperate friend climbed onto my back and put me in a choke hold. Now we were both drowning. Trying my best to reach the surface, I prayed with all my might for a miracle from God. Then, slowly but steadily, the power of God was manifest as I felt a hand propelling me toward the shallow end of the pool, bringing us to safety.\n\nThis experience confirmed a profound lesson President RussellM. Nelson once taught: When you reach up for the Lords power in your life with the same intensity that a drowning person has when grasping and gasping for air, power from Jesus Christ will be yours.\n\nDear children and young people, today I want to talk to you about the essential principle of faith in Jesus Christ.\n\nWhat does it mean to have faith in Christ? Does it mean we believe in Him or have a testimony that He is real? That may be a start, but its more than that. Have you ever thought of faith as trust? Think of the person you trust the mostperhaps a family member or a friend. Why do you trust them? It is probably because you have seen their constant love and help.\n\nWhen we have faith in Christ, we recognize His blessings and develop a relationship of trust with Him.\n\nIn a recent youth devotional, you were invited to meditate on a time in your life when you received a ray of heavenly light. Try this exercise!\n\nStart by meditating about Christ and the happiness His Atonement and gospel bring to your life. Also, make a record of the spiritually defining memories where God has been there for you, for your loved ones, and for the people in the scriptures. Now, these testimonies will not bring power to your life until the Spirit etches them in the fleshy tables of your heart. So ponder and record all God set in motion for these miracles to come at just the right time.\n\nNext, use this exercise as an opportunity to get closer to God. Pray to your Heavenly Father as if it were the first time. Express your love and gratitude for His blessings. Even ask Him how He feels about you and about the direction your life is taking.\n\nIf you are sincere and humble, you will hear His answer and begin a personal and lasting relationship with Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. Not only that, but your religious habits will become meaningful! For instance, you will look forward to your prayers, personal study, and temple worship as opportunities to get to know Them and be with Them.\n\nNotice that faith sprouts as we trust in Jesus Christ and blooms as we are faithful and loyal to Him. If you want a true relationship with Christ, show Him by making covenants and honoring them with faithfulness and loyalty. Making covenants with Jesus Christ builds hope. Honoring them builds faith.\n\nLet me use a personal example: When I was a child, I found my mother crying alone one day. When I asked her why, she gently said, I need you to be a good boy. Even though I knew that I was not the cause of her distress, I loved and trusted my mother like no one else and wanted to make her life less difficult. So, with tears in my eyes and with all the solemnity that a nine-year-old can have, I promised her that day I would always strive to be the best son and make her proud.\n\nCan you imagine the power that promise hadand still hason me?\n\nThat promise with her would guide my life. Before making decisions, I would consider whether my actions would please her. The bond of this promise and the relationship with my mother were the anchors for my conduct throughout my life.\n\nYears later, as I came to know Jesus Christ better, I already knew how to base my faith in Him. I made covenants with the Lord, and as I have sought to honor them, He has forgiven my sins, guided my life, and filled me with his love to the very core of my being. Christ has instilled in me a deep love, respect, and loyalty for Him.\n\nDo you understand why faith is a principle of action and that without faith it is impossible to please [God]?\n\nAs you try to do what pleases Him, you will say, like Joseph in Egypt when he was tempted by Potiphars wife, How then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God? And when faced with opposition, you will say, like the young Prophet Joseph, I knew it, and I knew that God knew it, and I could not deny it; I knew that by so doing I would offend God.\n\nSo faith in Jesus Christ is a bond of trust forged in loyalty and love. In other words, in gratitude for Gods merciful love (hesed), we show our loyal love (emunah) by keeping His commandments.\n\nChrist promises, He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them  shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him. If you commit to being loyal to Him, He will manifest His love for you.\n\nBut how should you respond to such adverse situations that require His miracles? While challenges are inevitable and sometimes frightening, simply walk undaunted toward Him, just as the 2025 FSY conference theme invites: Look unto me in every thought; doubt not, fear not.\n\nImagine that you are an explorer in uncharted territory. To overcome the obstacles ahead, you need a source of light. Your faithfulness to God and your constant interactions with Him are the fuel for your lantern. So when you encounter dark and perilous situations, instead of walking toward them blindly, you will turn on your lamp filled with the oil of faith in Christ to shed glimmers of hope on the uncertain path. Your past experiences will increase your hope that the Lord will sustain you on your journey.\n\nRemember my story at the pool? In that moment of despair, the miracle came in the way I had expected, but God does not guarantee that it will always be according to our will. Our faith must be centered in Christ and our hope in His blessings, as He chooses to send them. Expect miracles, but let God prevail in our lives.\n\nMy young friends, how much we love and trust you! You belong to the family of God and are children of the covenant. Believe and trust in Jesus Christ. He will enable you to truly become His disciples.\n\nI invite you to begin today to nurture your relationship with Jesus Christ. Make a commitment to never forsake Him.\n\nYour loyalty, love, and trust in Christ will shape your character and identity after His. You will gain confidence and strength to overcome Satans attacks. And when you make mistakes, you will yearn for His forgiveness. Finally, your hope for the future will be bright. He will trust you with His power to accomplish anything He expects of you, even the power to return to His presence.\n\nI testify to you of the joy that comes from singing the song of redeeming love and being encircled about eternally in the arms of his love. In the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen."

          "text": "In our family, we sometimes play a game we call The Crazy Trust Exercise. You may have played it too. Two people stand a few feet apart, one with their back toward the other. On a signal from the person behind, the person in front falls backward into the waiting arms of their friend.\n\nTrust is the foundation of all relationships. A threshold question to any relationship is Can I trust the other person? A relationship forms only when people are willing to place trust in each other. It is not a relationship if one person trusts completely but the other does not.\n\nEach of us is a beloved spirit son or daughter of a loving Heavenly Father. But while that spiritual genealogy provides a foundation, it does not of itself create a meaningful relationship with God. A relationship can be built only when we choose to trust in Him.\n\nHeavenly Father desires to build a close, personal relationship with each of His spirit children. Jesus expressed that desire when He prayed, That they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us. The relationship God seeks with each spirit child is one so close and personal that He will be able to share all He has and all He is. That kind of deep, enduring relationship can develop only when built upon perfect, total trust.\n\nFor His part, Heavenly Father has worked from the beginning to communicate His absolute trust in the divine potential of each of His children. Trust underlies the plan He presented for our growth and progression prior to our coming to earth. He would teach us eternal laws, create an earth, provide us with mortal bodies, give us the gift to choose for ourselves, and permit us to learn and grow by making our own choices. He wants us to choose to follow His laws and return to enjoy eternal life with Him and His Son.\n\nKnowing that we would not always make good choices, He also prepared a way for us to escape from the consequences of bad choices. He provided us a SaviorHis Son, Jesus Christto atone for our sins and make us clean again on condition of repentance. He invites us to use the precious gift of repentance regularly.\n\nEvery parent knows how difficult it is to trust a child enough to let them make their own decisions, especially when the parent knows the child is likely to make mistakes and suffer as a result. Yet Heavenly Father allows us to make the choices that will help us reach our divine potential! As Elder DaleG. Renlund taught, [His] goal in parenting is not to have His children do what is right; it is to have His children choose to do what is right and ultimately become like Him.\n\nNotwithstanding Gods trust in us, our relationship with Him will grow only to the degree we are willing to place our trust in Him. The challenge is that we live in a fallen world and have all experienced a betrayal of trust as the result of dishonesty, manipulation, coercion, or other circumstances. Once betrayed, we may struggle to trust again. These negative trust experiences with imperfect mortals may even impact our willingness to trust in a perfect Heavenly Father.\n\nSeveral years ago, two friends of mine, Leonid and Valentina, expressed interest in becoming members of the Church. As Leonid began to learn the gospel, he found it difficult to pray. Earlier in his life, Leonid had suffered from manipulation and control by superiors and had developed a distrust of authority. These experiences affected his ability to open his heart and express personal feelings to Heavenly Father. With time and study, Leonid gained a better understanding of Gods character and experienced feeling Gods love. Eventually, prayer became a natural way for him to express thanks and the love he was feeling for God. His increasing trust in God eventually led him and Valentina to enter into sacred covenants to strengthen their relationship with God and each other.\n\nIf prior loss of trust is keeping you from trusting God, please follow Leonids example. Patiently continue to learn more about Heavenly Father, His character, His attributes, and His purposes. Look for and record experiences feeling His love and power in your life. Our living prophet, President RussellM. Nelson, has taught that the more we learn about God, the easier it will be for us to trust Him.\n\nSometimes the best way to learn to trust God is simply by trusting Him. Like The Crazy Trust Exercise, sometimes we just need to be willing to fall backward and let Him catch us. Our mortal life is a test. Challenges that stretch us beyond our own capacity come frequently. When our own knowledge and understanding are inadequate, we naturally look for resources to help us. In an information-saturated world, there is no shortage of sources promoting their solutions to our challenges. However, the simple, time-tested counsel in Proverbs provides the best advice: Trust in the Lord with all thine heart. We show our trust in God by turning to Him first when confronted with lifes challenges.\n\nAfter I finished law school in Utah, our family faced the important decision of where to work and make our home. After counseling with each other and the Lord, we felt directed to move our family to the eastern United States, far from parents and siblings. Initially, things went well, and we felt confirmed in our decision. But then things changed. There was downsizing at the law firm, and I faced the prospect of no job or insurance at the very time our daughter Dora was born with serious medical challenges and long-term special needs. While confronting these challenges, I was extended a call to serve that would require significant time and commitment.\n\nI had never faced such a challenge and was overwhelmed. I began to question the decision we had made and its accompanying confirmation. We had trusted in the Lord, and things were supposed to work out. I had fallen backward, and it now appeared that no one was going to catch me.\n\nOne day the words Dont ask why; ask what I want you to learn came distinctly into my mind and heart. Now I was even more confused. In the very moment I was struggling with my earlier decision, God was inviting me to trust Him even more. Looking back, this was a critical point in my lifeit was the moment when I realized that the best way to learn to trust in God was simply by trusting Him. In the subsequent weeks, I watched with amazement as the Lord miraculously unfolded His plan to bless our family.\n\nGood teachers and coaches know that intellectual growth and physical strength can happen only when minds and muscles are stretched. Likewise, God invites us to grow by trusting His spiritual tutoring through soul-stretching experiences. Therefore, we can be sure that whatever trust we may have demonstrated in God in the past, another trust-stretching experience lies yet ahead. God is focused on our growth and progress. He is the Master Teacher, the complete coach who is always stretching us to help us realize more of our divine potential. That will always include a future invitation to trust Him just a little bit more.\n\nThe Book of Mormon teaches the pattern God uses to stretch us in order to build strong relationships with us. In Come, Follow Me, we recently studied about how Nephis trust in God was tested when he and his brothers were commanded to return to Jerusalem to obtain the brass plates. After their initial attempts failed, his brothers gave up and were ready to return without the plates. But Nephi chose to place his complete trust in the Lord and was successful in obtaining the plates. That experience likely strengthened Nephis confidence in God when his bow broke and the family was facing starvation in the wilderness. Again, Nephi chose to trust in God, and the family was saved. These successive experiences gave Nephi even stronger confidence in God for the enormous, trust-stretching task he would soon face of building a ship.\n\nThrough these experiences, Nephi strengthened his relationship with God by consistently and continuously trusting Him. God uses the same pattern with us. He extends us personal invitations to strengthen and deepen our trust in Him. Each time we accept and act on an invitation, our trust in God grows. If we ignore or decline an invitation, our progress stops until were ready to act on a new invitation.\n\nThe good news is that regardless of the trust we may or may not have chosen to place in God in the past, we can choose to trust God today and every day going forward. I promise that each time we do, God will be there to catch us, and our relationship of trust will grow stronger and stronger until the day that we become one with Him and His Son. Then we can declare like Nephi, O Lord, I have trusted in thee, and I will trust in thee forever. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen."

          "text": "Brothers and sisters, I feel joy as I respond to an impression to speak to children!\n\nGirls and boys, wherever you are in the world, I want to share something with you.\n\nOur Heavenly Father loves you! You are His child. He knows you. He wants to bless you. I pray with all my heart that you will feel His love.\n\nDo you like to receive gifts? I want to talk to you about a very special gift that Heavenly Father has given to you to help you. It is the gift of prayer. What a blessing prayer is! We can talk to Heavenly Father anytime, anywhere.\n\nWhen Jesus was on the earth, He taught us to pray. He said, Ask, and ye shall receive.\n\nWhat gifts can you pray for? There are many, but today I want to share three:\n\nPray to know.\n\nPray to grow.\n\nPray to show.\n\nLets talk about each one.\n\nWhat do you need to know?\n\nThere is a song about prayer that Primary children sing all over the world. It starts with a question. Do you know what song it is? If I were really brave, I would sing it to you!\n\nHeavenly Father, are you really there? And do you hear and answer evry childs prayer?\n\nHow can you know that Heavenly Father is really there, even when you cant see Him?\n\nPresident RussellM. Nelson has invited you to pour out your heart to your Heavenly Father.  And then listen! Listen to what you feel in your heart and to thoughts that come to your mind.\n\nHeavenly Father has a glorified body of flesh and bones and is the Father of your spirit. Because Heavenly Father has all power and knows all things, He can see all His children and can hear and answer every prayer. You can come to know for yourself that He is there and that He loves you.\n\nWhen you know that Heavenly Father is real and that He loves you, you can live with courage and hope! Pray, he is there; speak, he is listning.\n\nHave you ever felt alone? One day when our granddaughter Ashley was six years old, she was the only one without a friend to play with on the school playground. As she stood there, feeling unimportant and unseen, a specific thought came into her mind: Wait! Im not alone! I have Christ! Ashley knelt down right in the middle of the playground, folded her arms, and prayed to Heavenly Father. The moment she opened her eyes, a girl her age was standing there asking her if she wanted to play. Ashley came to know, We are important to the Lord, and we are never truly alone.\n\nSometimes you may want to know why something hard is happening in your life or why you didnt receive a blessing you prayed for. Often the best question to ask Heavenly Father is not why but what.\n\nDo you remember when Nephi and his family were hungry while they were traveling in the wilderness? When Nephi and his brothers went to hunt for food, Nephi broke his bow. But he didnt ask why.\n\nNephi made a new bow and asked his father, Lehi, where he could go to get food. Lehi prayed, and the Lord showed them where Nephi could go. Heavenly Father will guide you when you ask Him what you can do and what you can learn.\n\nHeavenly Father wants to help you grow! He loves us so much that He sent His Son, Jesus Christ, to show us the way to live. Jesus suffered, died, and was resurrected so we can be forgiven of our sins and grow to become more like Him.\n\nDo you want to grow in patience or in honesty? Do you want to grow in a skill? Maybe you are shy and want to grow in courage. Pray, he is there! Through His Spirit, your heart can change, and you can receive strength.\n\nMy new friend Jonah wrote: I often feel nervous on my way to school in the morning. I worry about things like being late, forgetting something, and taking tests. When I was 10, I started saying prayers on my drive to school with my mom. I ask for the help I need, and I pray for my family too. I also think of the things Im grateful for. [Praying to Heavenly Father has] helped me. Sometimes I dont feel the relief right as I get out of the car, but by the time Im at my classroom, I feel peaceful.\n\nJonahs faith is growing as he prays every day and then moves forward.\n\nYou can pray for help to show Heavenly Fathers love to others. Through His Spirit, Heavenly Father will help you notice someone who is sad so you can comfort them. He can help you show His love by forgiving someone. He can give you courage to serve someone and share with them that they are a child of God. You can help others come to know and love Jesus and Heavenly Father as you do.\n\nFor my whole life I prayed that my father would become a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Even as a young girl, I knew how many blessings he could receive. Our family could receive the blessings of being sealed for eternity. My family, friends, and I prayed often for him, but he didnt join the Church. Heavenly Father does not force anyone to make a choice. He can send us answers to our prayers in other ways.\n\nWhen I was old enough, I received my patriarchal blessing. In the blessing, the patriarch told me the best thing I could do to help my family be together in heaven was to be an example of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Thats what I could do!\n\nMy father lived to be 86. Five days after he died, I received a sacred feeling of joy. Heavenly Father let me know through His Spirit that my father wanted to receive the blessings of the gospel of Jesus Christ! I will never forget the day I knelt around the altar in the temple with my sister and brothers to be sealed to my parents. I had started praying for this blessing when I was in Primary, and I received it when I was a grandmother.\n\nPerhaps you are praying for blessings for your family and others you love. Dont give up! Heavenly Father will show you what you can do.\n\nShare with Heavenly Father what is in your heart. As you sincerely ask for His help, you will receive His Spirit to guide you. Praying every day will fill you with love for Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. This will help you want to follow Them your whole life!\n\nImagine what would happen if all the children in Africa, South America, Asia, Europe, North America, and Australia prayed every day. The whole world would be blessed with more of Gods love!\n\nI invite you to pray to know Heavenly Father is there, pray to grow to become like Him, and pray to show His love to others. I know He lives and loves you. Pray, he is there. In the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen."

We can pray for the revelatory companionship of the Holy Ghost, pray to align our will with His, pray to reflect upon our covenants and renew our commitment to keep them. We can pray to sustain and express love for our prophets, seers, and revelators; pray for the cleansing power of forgiveness; and pray for the strength to resist temptation. I invite you to make prayer a priority in your life, seeking each day to improve your communication with God.",
